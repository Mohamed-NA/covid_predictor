(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected  hundreds of millions globally, resulting in millions of deaths. People living  with HIV (PLWH) typically exhibit significantly lower antibody titers after  vaccination compared to healthy individuals, and are particularly vulnerable to  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their  compromised immune system. Given the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2  variants, monitoring immune responses in this high-risk population is crucial.  This study aims to investigate SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics in PLWH during the  Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5 waves in China, with a focus of vaccination and  antibody detection kits. METHODS: In December 2022, we recruited 147 PLWH who were initially infected  with the Omicron variant during the BA.5 wave. They were unvaccinated, fully  vaccinated, or received a dose of booster immunization. A four-month follow-up  was conducted during the XBB.1.5 wave. At both time points, information related  to basic demographic, HIV, and COVID-19 were collected. Peripheral blood samples  were obtained to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and HIV viral loads.  SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were measured using eight serological kits against  wild-type S strain, and two kits against BA.4/5 and XBB.1.5 strains,  respectively. RESULTS: Booster vaccination was associated with the highest antibody levels  after breakthrough infection, followed by full vaccination, and unvaccination.  The differences in antibody levels between three groups diminished by the second  follow-up in the reinfected PLWH. Those with HIV viral load higher than 30 IU/mL  exhibited reduced antibody responses. Spearman correlation analysis showed that  in the vaccinated individuals with Omicron reinfection, the kits against  wild-type strain showed poorer correlation with BA.4/5 and XBB.1.5 kits than  unvaccinated individuals, confirming antibody repertoire alterations after  repeated exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the importance of vaccination in enhancing  SARS-CoV-2 immunity among PLWH, with the diminishing differences in antibody  levels in repeated Omicron reinfections. The results emphasize the need for  continuous monitoring using variant-specific serological kits and adaptation of  vaccination strategies.  © 2025. The Author(s).

The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC, pose a  significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate identification  of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection, is essential for  effective patient management and resource allocation. However, traditional  models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced progression of  PASC. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available cohort of 18 PASC  patients, with text time series features based on Large Language Model  Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical risk annotated by clinical expert. We  propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and identify  progression events related to the risk. By integrating human expertise with  active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and enable  progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The ultimate  goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2 patient.  PMCID: PMC12306820 PMID: 40735095"

Background: SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination remains essential to prevent severe  COVID-19, particularly in vulnerable populations such as older adults. This  study evaluated the durability and dynamics of immune responses following  booster vaccination(s) in >65-year-old individuals and examined their  association with protection against new infections. Methods: Immune responses  were evaluated at 3, 9, and 15 months post-booster, measuring  SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies against spike [IgG(S)] and nucleocapsid  [IgG(N)] proteins, neutralizing activity against the Omicron BA.2 variant, and  cellular immunity. A subset of participants was tested before booster  administration. Regression analyses examined the influence of clinical and  immunological factors-including a bivalent fourth dose-on infection risk over  time. Results: Booster vaccination significantly enhanced IgG(S) and  neutralizing capacity, peaking at 3 months. Although a decline was observed by 9  months, responses remained above baseline. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2  infection exhibited higher IgG(S) levels and neutralizing titers, and  significantly lower reinfection rates (15%), compared to uninfected individuals.  A fourth vaccine dose further increased IgG(S) levels. While neutralizing  capacity was not consistently enhanced by the fourth dose, recipients  experienced a lower rate of new infections. Immune trajectory analyses revealed  that breakthrough infections elicited strong humoral responses comparable to  those seen in previously infected individuals, highlighting the role of hybrid  immunity. Conclusions: In older adults, booster vaccination induces durable  immune responses, with hybrid immunity offering enhanced protection. A fourth  dose boosts antibody levels and reduces infection risk, supporting its use in  this high-risk group. Continued monitoring is needed to determine the long-term  effectiveness of boosters, particularly against emerging variants.

Background and objective: The approval of mRNA-based vaccines for children and  adolescents has contributed to global efforts to control the SARS-CoV-2  pandemic. While hybrid immunity-combining prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and  vaccination-may offer enhanced protection, data on its effectiveness versus  vaccine-induced immunity in the pediatric population are limited. Methods: This  retrospective matched cohort study used linked health data from Norwegian  nationwide health registries and the Italian Pedianet network. The study  included children and adolescents aged 5-14 years eligible for COVID-19  vaccination at the time of approval (May/September 2021 and November  2021/January 2022, respectively). Mono- and two-dose vaccination schedules were  assessed, and hybrid immunity was defined as prior SARS-CoV-2 infection followed  by vaccination within 12 months. Conditional Cox regression models were used to  estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, adjusting for  sociodemographics, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization. Results: The study  included 626,537 children and adolescents in Norway and 38,938 in Italy. A  single dose of the vaccine did not reduce the risk of infection among  SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals in Norway (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), whereas it  was associated with an 8% risk reduction in Italy (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.96).  Among individuals with a recent prior infection (within 12 months), vaccination  was associated with a reduced risk of reinfection in Norway (HR: 0.10; 95% CI:  0.05-0.13), but not in Italy (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.83-1.80), compared to no  vaccination. Among those with prior infection, vaccination was associated with a  significantly reduced risk of reinfection in Norway (HR = 0.10; 95% CI:  0.05-0.20), but not in Italy (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.27-1.11). Hybrid immunity  provided greater protection against (re-)infection compared to vaccine-induced  immunity alone, with a 26% risk reduction observed in Norway (HR = 0.74; 95% CI  = 0.47-0.1.16) and an 86% reduction in Italy (HR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.09-0.21).  Conclusions: This analysis supports the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in  children, with hybrid immunity offering enhanced protection against reinfection.  Given the waning effectiveness of vaccines over time, continued research and  booster strategies are essential to sustain protection and mitigate  transmission.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with many  COVID-19 patients subsequently developing chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic  encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Long-term associations between COVID-19, new-onset  CFS/ME, and other independent predictors such as vaccination for SARS-CoV-2,  re-infection, and blood biomarkers at time of infection remain unclear. This  study investigated the incidence and independent predictors of developing  new-onset CFS/ME up to 4 years post SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to  COVID- controls. METHODS: This retrospective analysis conducted within the Montefiore Health  System from February 1, 2020, to January 12, 2024 included adults without a  prior diagnosis of fatigue or CFS/ME who were hospitalized for COVID-19  (n = 10,667), not hospitalized for COVID-19 (n = 25,409), and non-COVID-19  controls (n = 111,301). The observation time was between 30 days and 4 years  post index date. The outcome was new-onset CFS/ME. Multivariate adjusted hazard  ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, assessing risk posed  by SARS-CoV-2 infection, re-infection, and vaccination. Whether abnormal levels  of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase,  ferritin, hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and temperature  during hospitalization were associated with future CFS/ME risk was examined. RESULTS: Compared to COVID- controls, the risk of developing new-onset CFS/ME  was higher among both COVID-19 hospitalized (adjusted HR = 1.46 [1.07, 1.99])  and non-hospitalized patients (1.56 [1.25, 1.93]). Females (1.54 [1.27, 1.89]),  patients with liver disease (1.61 [1.29, 2.00]), autoimmune disorders (1.57  [1.18, 2.08]), and anxiety disorders (1.35 [1.04, 1.74]) were more likely to  develop CFS/ME (p < 0.05). Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with  increased risk of incident CFS/ME. COVID-19 vaccination status during the  initial phase of the rollout (prior to 2022) was associated with an increased  risk of new-onset CFS/ME (p < 0.05). None of the blood biomarkers during acute  COVID-19 were associated with new-onset CFS/ME risk (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of  new-onset CFS/ME, independent of hospitalization status. Females, and  individuals with autoimmune and anxiety disorders were more susceptible. These  findings highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and management of  fatigue-related symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Aim of the study was to define the patterns and determinants of symptom  persistence in Long-COVID. The study population was represented by a multicenter  cohort of patients with persisting symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data  collection included demographics, comorbidities, characteristics of acute  infection, vaccination, reinfection, plus 30 different symptoms. The  associations between covariates and persistence were assessed in multivariable  logistic regression models. The study evaluated, at a mean interval of 453 days  from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptom persistence in 755 patients who had  Long-COVID symptoms at a mean interval of 223 days from COVID-19. At second  evaluation, 423 (56.0%) patients still presented one or more symptoms and 332  (44.0%) were symptom free. In those who remained symptomatic, the mean number of  symptoms significantly reduced between the two evaluations. Compared to the  first evaluation, the overall mean symptom regression rate was 72%, with lower  regression rates observed for dyspnea (53%), anxiety (54%) and sleep  disturbances (55%). The risk of persistence was increased for female sex, higher  BMI, hospitalization and stronger ventilatory support during acute disease,  higher number of initial symptoms and particular comorbidities (anxiety, chronic  pulmonary disease, asthma), and decreased with the increase of age and time from  acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither SARS-CoV-2 vaccination nor reinfection  showed significant associations with persistence. In this case series, roughly  half of the patients that were symptomatic 7 months after acute SARS-CoV-2  infection remained symptomatic after an additional 7 months. The pattern and  predictors of persistence draw attention to certain particular risk factors and  manifestations that tend to persist longer than others.  © 2025.

Impact of Preexisting Rare Diseases on COVID-19 Severity, Reinfection, and Long  COVID, and the Modifying Effects of Vaccination and Antiviral Therapy: A  Retrospective Study from the N3C Data Enclave.  Yadaw AS, Sahner DK, Sid E, Chew EY, Pichard D, Mathé EA.  BACKGROUND: Over 10,000 rare diseases (RDs) affect more than 300 million people  globally, yet their influence on COVID-19 severity, reinfection risk, and long  COVID remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of RDs on these  outcomes and examines the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments  among individuals with and without RDs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using harmonized electronic  health records (EHRs) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C),  encompassing 21,704,702 individuals, including 4,825,605 with confirmed  SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 4, 2024. RDs were defined  using 12,003 conditions curated from GARD and Orphanet, mapped to OMOP concepts,  and classified into 18 RD classes based on medical specialty involvement.  Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and  life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We  applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment  weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and  associated p-values. Models were controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and  exposure to vaccination and antiviral treatments. FINDINGS: Of 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive  individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD)  patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without  life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without  hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of  life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental  defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions  (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for  otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during  embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine  diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99,  respectively).In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment  alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease  compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33;  95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and  antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI  0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast,  vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not  significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these  interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD.  However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone,  compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and  non-RD populations. INTERPRETATION: RD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes.  While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of  illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably,  vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD  populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to  protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing  long-term complications.

(#)Contributed equally  OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against reinfection and  severe COVID-19 disease; however, this protective effect may diminish over time.  We assessed waning of natural immunity conferred by previous infection against  severe disease and symptomatic reinfection in Brazil and Scotland. DESIGN: We undertook a test-negative design study and nested case-control  analysis to estimate waning of natural immunity against severe COVID-19 outcomes  and symptomatic reinfection using national linked datasets. We used logistic  regression to estimate ORs with 95% CIs. A stratified analysis assessed immunity  during the Omicron dominant period in Brazil. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We included data from the adult populations of Brazil  and Scotland from 1 June 2020 to 30 April 2022. OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe COVID-19 was defined as hospitalisation or death.  Reinfection was defined as reverse-transcriptase PCR or rapid antigen test  confirmed at least 120 days after primary infection. RESULTS: From Brazil, we included 30 881 873 tests and 1 301 665 severe COVID-19  outcomes, and from Scotland, we included 1 520 201 tests and 7988 severe  COVID-19 outcomes. Against severe outcomes, sustained protection was observed  for at least 12 months after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with little evidence  of waning: <6 months postprimary infection: Brazil OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.09 to  0.11), Scotland OR 0.01 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.05); >12 months postprimary infection:  Brazil OR 0.12 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.14), Scotland OR 0.03 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.04).  For symptomatic reinfection, Brazilian data demonstrated evidence of waning in  the 12 months following primary infection, although some residual protection  remained beyond 12 months: <6 months postprimary infection: OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.19  to 0.20); >12 months postprimary infection: OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.43). The  greatest reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was in individuals with  hybrid immunity (history of previous infection and vaccination), with sustained  protection against severe outcomes at 12 months postprimary infection. During  the Omicron dominant period in Brazil, odds of symptomatic reinfection were  higher and increased more quickly over time when compared with the overall study  period, although protection against severe outcomes was sustained at 12 months  postprimary infection (whole study: OR 0.12 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.14); Omicron  phase: OR 0.15 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.19)). CONCLUSION: Cross-national analyses demonstrate sustained protection against  severe COVID-19 disease for at least 12 months following natural SARS-CoV-2  infection, with vaccination further enhancing protection. Protection against  symptomatic reinfection was lower with evidence of waning, but there remained a  protective effect beyond 12 months from primary infection.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients remain at risk for protracted SARS-CoV-2  infections with persistent viral shedding that could pose a wider public health  risk. The optimal therapeutic strategy remains unknown. METHODS: We describe a sequential case series of immunocompromised adults with  protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection who received dual/extended antiviral therapy  (median 23d nirmatrelvir/r; 8d remdesivir). Protracted infection was defined as  persistent viral shedding and prolonged symptoms unresponsive to antiviral  monotherapy in B-cell-depleted patients. Plasma anti-spike IgG and spike antigen  were analyzed using the single molecule array assay (Simoa), viral RNA levels  defined by cycle thresholds (Ct) from clinical assays and quantitative RNA  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and whole virus and targeted nsp5/nsp12  sequencing were performed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated with  dual/extended antivirals. Viral sequencing supported the presence of protracted  infections in all tested, but only one participant demonstrated mutations  conferring antiviral resistance. Humoral immune responses were blunted both at  initiation and completion of therapy. All participants responded to  dual/extended antiviral therapy with negative PCR at a median of 13 days  post-treatment, no evidence of virologic recurrence, and no clinical relapse at  one year. One patient with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 testing was  demonstrated to have a new infection by sequencing. CONCLUSION: Dual/extended antiviral therapy with nirmatrelvir/r and remdesivir  can be effective for protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection in B-cell-depleted patients  who fail antiviral monotherapy, despite persistently blunted humoral immune  responses. Additionally, immunocompromised hosts are at risk of both protracted  infection and early re-infection, which can be differentiated by viral  sequencing.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges with COVID-19 has been that although  there are known factors associated with a worse prognosis, clinicians have been  unable to predict which patients, with similar risk factors, will die or require  intensive care unit (ICU) care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a personalized artificial intelligence  model to predict the patient risk of mortality and ICU admission related to  SARS-CoV-2 infection during the initial medical evaluation before any kind of  treatment. METHODS: It is a population-based, observational, retrospective study covering  from February 1, 2020, to January 24, 2023, with different circulating  SARS-CoV-2 viruses, vaccinated status, and reinfections. It includes patients  attended by the reference hospital in Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The models  used the random forest technique, Shapley Additive Explanations method, and  processing with Python (version 3.10.0; Python Software Foundation) and  scikit-learn (version 1.3.0). The models were applied to different epidemic  SARS-CoV-2 infection waves. Data were collected from 11,975 patients (4998  hospitalized and 6737 discharged). Predictive models were built with records  from 4758 patients and validated with 6977 patients after evaluation in the  emergency department. Variables recorded were age, sex, place of birth, clinical  data, laboratory results, vaccination status, and radiologic data at admission. RESULTS: The best mortality predictor achieved an area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.89, specificity  of 0.82, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.35, and mean negative predictive  value (NPV) of 0.98. The ICU admission predictor had an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity  of 0.75, specificity of 0.88, PPV of 0.37, and NPV of 0.98. During validation,  the mortality model exhibited good performance for the nonhospitalized group,  achieving an AUC of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.88, specificity of 0.98, PPV of 0.21,  and NPV of 0.99, predicting the death of 30 of 34 patients who were not  hospitalized. For the hospitalized patients, the mortality model achieved an AUC  of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.74, PPV of 0.24, and NPV of 0.98.  The model for predicting ICU admission had an AUC of 0.82, sensitivity of 1.00,  specificity of 0.59, PPV of 0.05, and NPV of 1.00. The models' metrics presented  stability along all pandemic waves. Key mortality predictors included age,  Charlson value, and tachypnea. The worse prognosis was linked to high values in  urea, erythrocyte distribution width, oxygen demand, creatinine, procalcitonin,  lactate dehydrogenase, heart failure, D-dimer, oncological and hematological  diseases, neutrophil, and heart rate. A better prognosis was linked to higher  values of lymphocytes and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Partial or no  vaccination provided less protection than full vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The artificial intelligence models demonstrated stability across  pandemic waves, indicating their potential to assist in personal health services  during the 3-year pandemic, particularly in early preventive and predictive  clinical situations.  ©Jose Manuel Ruiz Giardin, Óscar Garnica, Nieves Mesa Plaza, Juan Víctor  SanMartín López, Ana Farfán Sedano, Elena Madroñal Cerezo, Miguel Ángel Duarte  Millán, Aida Izquierdo Martínez, Luis Rivas, Marta Rivilla, Alejandro Morales  Ortega, Begoña Frutos Pérez, Cristina De Ancos Aracil, Ruth Calderón, Guillermo  Soria Fernandez, Jorge Marrero Francés, David Bernal Bello, Jose Ángel Satué  Bartolomé, María Toledano Macías, Sara Piedrabuena García, Marta Guerrero  Santillán, Rafael Cristóbal, Belen Mora, Laura Velázquez Ríos, Vanesa García de  Viedma, Paula Cuenca Ruiz, Ibone Ayala Larrañaga, Lorena Carpintero, Celia Lara,  Alvaro Ricardo Llerena, Virginia García Bermúdez, Gema Delgado Cárdenas, Paloma  Pardo Rovira, Elena Tejero Sánchez, Maria Jesús Domínguez García, Carolina  Mariño, Cristina Bravo, Ana Ontañon, Mario García, Jose Ignacio Hidalgo Pérez,  Santiago Prieto Menchero, Natalia González Pereira, Sonia Gonzalo Pascua, Jorge  Tarancón Rey, Luis Antonio Lechuga Suárez, FUENCOVID.

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with prior  SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly for Omicron subvariants. We  evaluated vaccine effectiveness against reinfection with Omicron BA.1/2, BA.4/5,  XBB, and later subvariants among 5- to 17-year-olds using data from the RECOVER  initiative, a national electronic health record database covering 37 U.S.  pediatric institutions. We emulated target trials by age group and variant  period, comparing previously infected participants between January 2022 and  August 2023. During the BA.1/2 period, vaccination reduced the risk of  reinfection, with effectiveness rates of 62% in children and 65% in adolescents.  During the BA.4/5 period, protection effectiveness in children was 57%, whereas  no statistically significant protection was observed in adolescents. During the  XBB or later period, no significant protection was observed in either group. In  summary, COVID-19 vaccination provided protection against reinfection during  early and mid-Omicron periods in previously infected pediatric populations, but  effectiveness declined for later variants.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed millions of people  worldwide, continues to be marked by waves of reinfections. We aimed to assess  the incidence and clinical characteristics of reinfection in COVID- 19 cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center descriptive study was conducted. Data were  collected from all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR from  March 18, 2020, the onset of the first major COVID-19 wave, until the end of  2020. All PCR-positive patients were followed-up, and those who had SARS-CoV-2  PCR positivity again at least 90 days after the initial onset were contacted via  telemedicine. RESULTS: 5814 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with PCR positive in the first  wave were included. The incidence of reinfection among the cohort of patients  infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of COVID-19 was 0.73%. Among  healthcare workers, the 1-year reinfection rate was 2.14%, 3.9 times higher than  non-healthcare workers. We observed that the clinical course was milder and less  complicated in patients who had reinfection. In cases of reinfection among fully  vaccinated individuals, statistically significantly fewer symptoms were  observed. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that healthcare workers are at approximately four times  greater risk of reinfection. Reinfections generally presented with a milder  clinical course.

INTRODUCTION: Reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) has been occurring more frequently. Healthcare workers are among  the most at-risk groups due to their direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while  providing medical care. We aimed to understand the potential factors that affect  reinfection. METHODOLOGY: 1399 healthy workers at the General Hospital of Central Theater  Command were enrolled for an online questionnaire from 27 June to 10 July 2023.  The selected individuals were divided into the primary infection group and the  secondary infection group based on the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: About 95% of the total population had been vaccinated. A higher  proportion of the primary group had received 3 doses of vaccines and inactivated  vaccines, than the secondary group (p < 0.001). The symptoms, duration, and  severity of the majority of participants significantly decreased during  secondary infection, compared to primary infection. After adjusting for factors  such as gender, age, vaccine dose, and vaccine type; multiple regression  analysis indicated that the patients with disease duration > 7 days or long  coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID-19) history during primary infection had a  higher risk of secondary infection with Omicron (odds ratio, OR = 2.2, p <  0.001; OR = 2.4, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patients with history of long COVID-19 or longer duration of  disease after primary infection had a higher risk of Omicron reinfection. This  study identified the clinical manifestations during Omicron primary and  secondary infection; and the potential factors that may influence reinfection.

This study investigated how different  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural infection  histories before an omicron infection, with or without vaccination, influence  protection against subsequent omicron reinfection. METHODS: Three national, matched, retrospective cohort studies were conducted in  Qatar from February 28, 2020, to August 12, 2024 to compare incidence of omicron  reinfection between individuals with two omicron infections (omicron  double-infection cohort) and those with one (omicron single-infection cohort);  the omicron double-infection cohort with individuals who had a pre-omicron  infection followed by an omicron reinfection (pre-omicron-omicron  double-infection cohort); and the pre-omicron-omicron double-infection cohort  with the omicron single-infection cohort. RESULTS: Here we show that, in the first study, comparing the omicron  double-infection cohort to the omicron single-infection cohort, the adjusted  hazard ratio (aHR) is 1.27 (95% CI: 1.13-1.43); 0.93 (95% CI: 0.68-1.28) for the  unvaccinated and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.52) for the vaccinated. In the second  study, comparing the omicron double-infection cohort to the pre-omicron-omicron  double-infection cohort, the aHR is 1.37 (95% CI: 1.13-1.65); 1.12 (95% CI:  0.63-1.97) for the unvaccinated and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.16-1.74) for the vaccinated.  In the third study, comparing the pre-omicron-omicron double-infection cohort to  the omicron single-infection cohort, the aHR is 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92-1.03); 0.75  (95% CI: 0.66-0.85) for the unvaccinated and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97-1.09) for the  vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Immune history shapes protection against omicron reinfection, with  pre-omicron-omicron immunity enhancing protection, while repeated similar  exposures reduce protection against new variants.  Plain Language Summary: This study explores how different histories of COVID-19  infection and vaccination affect protection against future infections. The  investigators used data from Qatar’s national health system, which includes  information on COVID-19 tests, vaccinations, and hospitalisations. The study  involved matching groups of people based on factors like age, sex, and  vaccination status to compare their risk of reinfection. The study found that  having two omicron infections provided less protection against future omicron  reinfection than having just one omicron infection or a combination of  pre-omicron and omicron infections. These results suggest that repeated  infections with the same variant may not strengthen immunity as much as mixed  exposures. The findings improve our understanding of how immune history shapes  protection and may help guide vaccination and public health strategies.  © 2025. The Author(s).

However, few studies  have examined the impact of the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection on perceived stress and depressive symptoms.  The present study aimed to examine whether the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection  is associated with perceived stress and subsequent depressive symptoms and to  determine whether socioeconomic status (SES) moderates this mediating effect. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 30,053 Chinese residents  (15,011 males, 49.9 %) aged 19-107 years were recruited between June 20 and  August 31, 2023. The participants recalled their frequency of SARS-CoV-2  infection. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were measured via the  Perceived Stress Scale-4 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. SES was  assessed via a 7-point self-report scale. MANOVA, ANOVA, and conditional  indirect effect analysis were performed. RESULTS: Residents with one SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced fewer depressive  symptoms than those with no infections. Perceived stress mediated the  association between one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced depressive  symptoms, with higher SESs amplifying this association. Conversely, among  individuals with multiple infections, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was  associated with increased depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the postpandemic era, repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections still  significantly affect residents' mental health. Attention should be paid to the  psychological stress and depressive symptoms of high-risk groups, such as  individuals with a history of repeated infections.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

BACKGROUND: The clinical consequences of repeated severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not clear, especially as they  relate to long-term symptoms after infection. We analyzed data collected for the  Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE) to  determine whether reinfection changes the likelihood of symptoms 3-6 months  after reinfection compared with the likelihood in individuals experiencing a  single infection. METHODS: Individuals reporting a single SARS-CoV-2 infection or a single  reinfection were included in this analysis. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test occurring  ≥90 days after a first infection was considered a reinfection. Outcomes included  severe fatigue (fatigue severity score ≥25) and the presence of organ system  symptoms 3-6 months after the last infection. RESULTS: The analysis included 886 individuals, 415 (46.8%) of whom experienced  reinfection. For individuals who experienced their first infections in either  the pre-Delta or Delta periods, the odds of having ≥3 symptoms 3-6 months after  their most recent infection was lower in those reinfected than those with a  single infection (weighted adjusted odds ratio, 0.45 [95% confidence interval,  .21-.95] and 0.51 [.32-.79], respectively). However, in individuals reporting  their first infection during the Omicron wave, the odds of reporting ≥3 symptoms  after the most recent infection was higher in those reinfected than in those  with a single infection (weighted adjusted odds ratio, 1.54 [95% confidence  interval, 1.02-2.34]). CONCLUSIONS: The timing of initial infection, reinfection, and the variants  involved may play important roles in longer-term clinical outcomes. Repeated  infection with Omicron variants may increase the risk of long-term symptoms.  © The Author(s) 2025.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Older adults with frailty are at-risk of worse outcomes  following respiratory-viral-infections such as COVID-19. Data on effectiveness  of vaccination/boosting in frail older adults during Omicron is lacking. METHODS: National healthcare-claims data and COVID-19 registries were utilized  to enroll a cohort of older Singaporeans (≥60 years) as of 1 January 2022,  divided into low/intermediate/high-risk for frailty; matching weights were  utilized to adjust for sociodemographic differences/vaccination uptake at  enrolment across frailty categories. Competing-risk-regression (Fine-Gray)  taking death as a competing risk, with matching weights applied, was utilized to  compare risks of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and severe COVID-19 across  frailty levels (low/intermediate/high-risk), with estimates stratified by  booster status. Individuals were followed up until study end-date (20 December  2023). RESULTS: 874,160 older adults were included during Omicron-predominant  transmission; ~10% had intermediate/high-frailty-risk. Risk of  hospitalization/severe COVID-19 was elevated in those with  intermediate/high-frailty-risk up to XBB/JN.1 transmission. Boosting was  associated with decreased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization across all  frailty categories in infection-naïve individuals. However, in infection-naïve  older adults with high-frailty-risk, while receipt of first boosters was  associated with lower risk of COVID-19-hospitalization/severe COVID-19,  additional booster doses did not reduce risk. In reinfected older adults, first  boosters were still associated with lower hospitalization risk  (adjusted-hazards-ratio, aHR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.33-0.92) among the non-frail,  but not in the intermediate/high-frailty-risk minority. CONCLUSIONS: First boosters were associated with reduced adverse COVID-19  outcomes across all frailty categories in infection-naïve older adults during  Omicron. However, in the high-frailty minority, boosting did not additionally  reduce risk in reinfected individuals with hybrid immunity, and beyond the first  booster for infection-naïve individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To assess COVID-19 reinfection rates among healthcare workers (HCWs)  in Vietnam and identify associated work environment risk factors. METHODS: 875 HCWs were followed for 20 to 24 weeks with bi-weekly testing. Risk  factor data were collected via self-administered questionnaires. Cumulative  incidence proportions and incidence rates were calculated. The associations  between reinfection rates and risk factors were analyzed by Cox proportional  hazard regression models. RESULTS: The reinfection rate was 1.11 cases per 1,000 person-days, affecting  12.7% of HCWs. Using all prevention measures in medical settings did not reduce  reinfection risk, while adhering to all prevention measures in the community  reduced risk. Risk was lower among females, older individuals, and nurses, but  higher among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated HCWs. CONCLUSION: Further assessment of work- and non-work related risk factors for  HCWs COVID-19 reinfection is needed.(STROBE Checklist Item No.1b ,  http://links.lww.com/JOM/C18).

People living with HIV-1 (PLWH) treated with combination antiretroviral therapy  (cART) have similar incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without  HIV-1 (PWoH). Yet, roughly 25% PLWH worldwide are currently not accessing cART.  The influence of CD4+ T cell depletion on human coronavirus (HCoV) (re)infection  risk, including SARS-CoV-2, is largely unknown. In this research, we  investigated the incidence of infection by the four endemic HCoVs (HCoV-NL63,  HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1), to inform on future reinfections by  SARS-CoV-2. We compared the HCoV infection incidence rate between PLWH (n = 24)  and PWoH (n = 25) who were followed up in 1984-1993; i.e., before cART became  generally available in high income countries. Both populations were followed up  at 6-month intervals for 7 or 8 years. We also compared the HCoV infection  incidence rate among PLWH with and without immune deficiency, defined as CD4+ T  cell count < 350 cell/mm3 and > 350 cell/mm3 respectively. We found that the  antibody levels for all HCoVs were significantly lower in PLWH than PWoH across  all timepoints. However, we observed no significant difference on HCoV infection  incidence rate between PLWH and PWoH. We also observed no difference in HCoV  infection incidence rate among PLWH with and without immune deficiency. We  conclude that PLWH not on cART may not be at increased risk of HCoV  reinfections.

OBJECTIVES: Since the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, COVID-19  reinfection has become an increasing concern, particularly during the spread of  the Omicron variant. Despite numerous international studies on COVID-19  reinfection, research focusing on healthcare workers, particularly those in  primary care settings in mainland China, remains limited. This study aims to  evaluate COVID-19 reinfection rates among primary healthcare workers (PHWs) in  Jiangsu Province and to explore potential risk factors contributing to  reinfection. METHODS: This study utilized a combination of online questionnaires and on-site  surveys to conduct two waves of investigation targeting PHWs after epidemic  control policy adjustment in Jiangsu Province. Differences between the infection  at the baseline visit and re-infection at the follow-up visit were analyzed, and  multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the factors influencing  reinfection. RESULTS: A total of 5,541 PHWs were included in the study. At the baseline  visit, the initial infection rate was 85.85% [95% confidence interval (CI):  84.93-86.77%], and the self-reported reinfection rate was 40.05% (95% CI:  38.65-41.44%). After adjustment, the reinfection rate was 29.41% (95% CI:  28.12-30.71%). The median reinfection interval between the two infections was  146 days (Interquartile range: 129-164 days). Logistic regression model revealed  that female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 1.376, 95% CI: 1.190-1.592], history of fever  clinic work (OR = 1.179, 95% CI: 1.045-1.330), working over 8 h per day  (OR = 1.178, 95% CI: 1.040-1.336), being a nurse (OR = 1.201, 95% CI:  1.029-1.402), and a ""less meat, more vegetables"" diet (OR = 1.206, 95% CI:  1.020-1.426) were significant risk factors for reinfection. Additionally,  regular physical exercise was found to be a protective factor (OR = 0.861, 95%  CI: 0.754-0.983). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 reinfection rates were relatively high among PHWs in  Jiangsu Province, particularly among women, nurses, those with fever clinic  experience and working over 8 h per day. This study offers valuable insights for  the prevention of COVID-19 reinfection and the development of protection  strategies for PHWs. It is recommended that more targeted protective measures be  implemented for high-risk groups, including appropriate work arrangements,  regular health monitoring, and the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 and mpox outbreaks affected hepatitis  C virus (HCV) related behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM) with a  cleared HCV infection. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis from the international ICECREAM trial (2021-2024). METHODS: During the pre-randomization phase (i.e., without any intervention)  individuals completed questionnaires on sexual and drug use behaviours and  whether the COVID-19 (since start trial) or mpox (shortly after the mpox  outbreak in 2022) outbreaks caused changes in these behaviours, all referring to  the preceding six months. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to model  changes in behaviours due to COVID-19 or mpox measures and mixed-effects linear  regression to model the average HCV-MOSAIC risk score, as a proxy of  HCV-associated risk behaviour, over calendar time. RESULTS: 220 MSM (n = 117 from the Netherlands, n = 103 from France) were  included. Among 208 that completed the baseline questionnaire, 171 (82.2%) were  MSM with HIV. The proportion of individuals reporting any impact of COVID-19  restrictions on risk behaviours, mainly lowering number of partners, decreased  from 74.7% in September 2021 to 6.7% in September 2024 ( p  < 0.001) and  reporting any impact of mpox from 41.9% in November 2022 to 6.0% in September  2024 ( p  = 0.001). The average HCV-MOSAIC risk score remained constant over  time ( p  = 0.59) and was consistently ≥2.0, indicating high reinfection  susceptibility. CONCLUSION: HCV-related behaviours decreased when COVID-19 and mpox measures  were in place. However, individuals still engaged in behaviours associated with  HCV, highlighting the importance of continued sexual health services and  prevention efforts during such outbreaks.

Available  antiviral drugs are effective only for specific viruses. It is imperative to  develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)  biomimetic strategy holds great promise to design broad-spectrum antiviral  materials. However, the reversible binding of HSPG-mimicking nanoparticles with  virions presents a potential risk of reinfection. Herein, a sulfonated liposome  (SC_Lip) that can trigger phase transition below pH 6.5 is screened to combat  viral infection at all stages. SC_Lip can realize pH-induced phase transition,  which triggers membrane fusion with viral envelope and subsequent viral  inactivation. Therefore, SC_Lip exhibits virucidal activity via membrane fusion  with viral envelope in both acidic viral infection microenvironment and  intracellular acidic lysosomes. The broad-spectrum virucidal activity of SC_Lip  is confirmed by different types of viruses, including coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),  retrovirus (LV), and herpesvirus (HSV-1). The in vivo antiviral effect of SC_Lip  is further verified by a rat HSV-1 anterior uveitis model. Overall, SC_Lip with  broad-spectrum virucidal ability holds great promise to fight against emerging  viral pandemics in the future.  © 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the challenge of SARS-CoV-2  reinfection, particularly with the emergence of new variants. This study aimed  to identify epidemiological and clinical factors associated with COVID-19  reinfection in patients treated in the Cusco Region of Peru during 2022, a  high-altitude area with unique demographic and geographic characteristics. METHODS: A retrospective, observational, case-control study was conducted,  analyzing 216 patients (108 reinfection cases and 108 primary infection  controls). Data were collected from clinical records and analyzed using  statistical methods, including chi-square tests and multivariate regression. The  study focused on demographic, epidemiological, and clinical factors, with  statistical significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Males had a 1.51 times higher risk of reinfection compared to females  (p<0.05). Patients from regions outside Cusco had a 16.03 times higher risk of  reinfection than local residents (p<0.05). No significant associations were  found between reinfection and clinical factors such as symptoms or  comorbidities. The overall reinfection rate was 0.97%, consistent with global  trends. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that high altitude may confer protective  effects against reinfection, potentially due to physiological adaptations to  hypoxia. Males and individuals with interregional mobility were identified as  high-risk groups. These results highlight the need for tailored public health  strategies in high-altitude regions, focusing on surveillance and prevention for  vulnerable populations. Further research is recommended to explore the  biological mechanisms underlying these findings and to assess the impact of  emerging viral variants on reinfection dynamics.

To assess SARS-CoV-2 reinfection incidence in the post-vaccination period, we  carried out a prospective cohort study of blood donors from Amazonas and Sao  Paulo States, Brazil. Anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin (IgG anti-N) tests  carried out by blood centers in 2020 were used to identify previous SARS-CoV-2  infections in blood donors and divide them into two groups: prior infection  (n=386) and no prior infection (n=111). From March 2021 to January 2022, donors  were followed up for six months, during which IgG anti-N and real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction tests were performed every two months to  detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. Symptoms and vaccination status were also  recorded. Most participants (93.6%) received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.  Reinfection incidence in the prior infection group equaled 1.39 per 100  person-months (95% CI: 0.90-2.06), in comparison to 2.68 per 100 person-months  (95% CI: 1.28-4.93) for new infections in those without prior infection. The  incidence risk ratio showed no significant association (0.52, 95% CI:  0.25-1.13). However, prior infection significantly increased the probability of  remaining uninfected (Log-rank: p=0.009). Most reinfections (84%) showed no  symptoms and occurred post-vaccination during the Delta and Omicron waves. IgG  anti-N seroprevalence decreased in the prior infection group (from 35.5% at  baseline to 22.5% after six months, p=0.003). Despite no significant incidence  risk ratio differences, donors with prior infection had lower infection rates  and a higher likelihood of remaining uninfected. Persistent post-vaccination  asymptomatic infections emphasize the need for ongoing prevention, genomic  surveillance, and booster programs to address emerging variants and protect  vulnerable populations.

(#)Contributed equally  SARS-CoV-2 undergoes continuous mutations during transmission, resulting in a  variety of Omicron subvariants. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 and its  descendants JN.1, KP.2, KP.1.1 have been identified as the primary variants  spreading globally. These emerging Omicron variants have increased  transmissibility, potentially elevating the risk of viral reinfection in the  population. However, the biological characteristics of newly-emerged Omicron  subvariants in infecting host cells remain unclear. In this study, we assessed  the neutralization effect of BA.2.86 and its descendant JN.1, as well as D614G,  BA.2, BA.4/5, XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1 and JG.3 on convalescent sera  obtained from individuals infected with BA.5 or XBB.1.5 strain. We evaluated the  biological characteristics of variants spike proteins by measuring viral  infectivity, affinity for receptors, and membrane fusion. Compared to  XBB-related subvariants, BA.2.86 exhibited a diminished immune escape response,  but JN.1 displayed a markedly augmented immune escape capability, which was  closely related to its rapid transmission. BA.2.86 was less infectious in  susceptible cells, while the JN.1 variant exhibited relatively high infectivity.  Notably, BA.2.86 and JN.1 exhibited low fusion activity in 293 T-ACE2 cells, but  relatively high fusogenicity in transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)  overexpression cells. This study explored the evolutionary characteristics of  emerging Omicron subvariants in host adaptation, and provided new strategies for  the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  © 2025.

BACKGROUND: Identifying rare disease (RD) patients in electronic health records  (EHR) is challenging, as more than 10,000 rare diseases are not typically  captured by clinical coding systems. This limits the assessment of clinical  outcomes for RD patients. This study introduces a semiautomated approach to map  RDs to appropriate codes, that is applicable across various EHR systems. By  improving RD patient identification, this method facilitates the analysis of  clinical outcomes and disease severity in the RD population. We exemplify this  by utilizing large EHR datasets such as those in the National COVID Cohort  Collaborative (N3C) with over 21 million patients. METHODS: We developed a semiautomated workflow to enumerate RD-specific  SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 codes, starting with 12,003 GARD IDs mapped to ORPHANET.  This process linked RDs to SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 codes, applying exclusion  criteria based on group of disorders. We created an extensive list of SNOMED-CT  codes with descendants from the OHDSI atlas and performed phenotype filtering,  removing irrelevant codes. The final list included 12,081 SNOMED-CT codes and  357 ICD-10 codes for further analysis, enabling the identification and mapping  of rare diseases in EHR. RESULTS: Our semiautomated workflow identified 357 RD-specific ICD-10 codes and  12,081 SNOMED-CT codes representing 6,342 RDs which are categorized into 30  Orphanet linearization classes. We exemplify the utility of these codes by  performing a preliminary univariate analysis of COVID-19 outcomes in a large  cohort of 4,835,718 COVID-19 positive individuals in N3C, of which 404,735  (8.37%) were identified as having preexisting RD. The mortality and  hospitalization risk ratios for rare RD classes ranged from 0.23 - 5.28 and 0.93  - 3.13, respectively (p-values <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic and automated workflow enables rapid identification  of rare disease patients across diverse EHR systems. We demonstrate its utility  by evaluating COVID-19 severity outcomes by rare disease classes in the N3C  cohort. These findings support the need for targeted preventive healthcare  interventions and highlight the potential for future research on long COVID,  COVID-19 reinfection, and other outcomes in the rare disease population.

BACKGROUND: High spike-based vaccine coverage led to a high seroprevalence of  anti-spike (S) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Japanese adults in 2024.  Nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic continues, and individuals with hybrid  immunity are becoming more common in these populations. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to measure serum  anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in 4496 Japanese adults as part of the national  seroepidemiological survey. This study evaluated the correlation between  first-visit anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and their effectiveness in providing  protection until the second visit during the Omicron BA.5 epidemic. RESULTS: Reduced symptomatic infection risk was found to be associated with  anti-S antibody, anti-nucleocapsid (N) antibody, and BA.5 neutralizing antibody  levels. However, the reduced asymptomatic infection risk associated with anti-S  antibody or BA.5 neutralizing antibody levels was limited. In contrast, higher  anti-N antibody levels were strongly linked to a reduced asymptomatic infection  risk. Furthermore, higher anti-N antibody levels were also associated with a  reduced risk of re-infection in individuals with hybrid immunity. CONCLUSION: These observations highlight the potential of anti-N antibody level  as a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection and  re-infection. The findings indicate that individuals with hybrid immunity have a  distinct protective immunity against both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection  beyond serum anti-S and neutralizing antibodies against circulating viral  strains, which correlate with serum anti-N antibodies.  Plain Language Summary: During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines helped many  people develop antibodies, proteins that fight infections, against the virus.  However, the virus continues to spread, and some people have both  vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity, known as hybrid immunity. This  study used 4496 Japanese adults to understand how different antibodies protect  against COVID-19, especially during the Omicron BA.5 wave. They measured levels  of two antibody types (anti-S and anti-N) in the participants’ blood. The study  found that higher levels of anti-N antibodies were linked to a lower risk of  getting infected again, even without symptoms. This suggests that anti-N  antibodies are important for protection, especially in people with hybrid  immunity. This suggests that future COVID-19 vaccines could be improved by  focusing on inducing strong anti-N antibody responses or mimicking hybrid  immunity, which might offer better protection against re-infections.  © 2025.

Background/Objectives: Patients with chronic lung diseases, such as cystic  fibrosis, were considered a risk group for a severe course of coronavirus  disease 2019 at the beginning of the pandemic. However, mounting evidence  suggests that this group may not face an elevated risk for a severe SARS-CoV-2  infection. Methods: Here, we present data on the incidence and clinical course  of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a single pediatric CF centre in Austria. Clinical  variables were analyzed for their potential impact on disease acquisition and  severity. A total of 135 young people with CF were assessed from February 2020  until December 2022. Results: Eighty-four patients were infected with  SARS-CoV-2, out of which nine patients reported re-infection, resulting in 93  SARS-CoV-2 infections. Most infections, 76/93 (82%), occurred during the period  of omicron variant predominance. Higher body mass index and respiratory  colonization with Haemophilus influenzae before the beginning of the pandemic  were significantly associated with the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.  All patients had an uncomplicated COVID-19 course, regardless of the SARS-CoV-2  variant and COVID-19 vaccine status at infection. The most frequent symptoms  were rhinitis (53%), fatigue (49%), cephalea (43%), and fever (38%). Neither  oxygen therapy nor hospitalization were needed for any of the patients. Lung  function parameters (FEV1, FVC, FEF50, LCI), both in the early post-viral as  well as late post-viral stages, were not significantly impacted by SARS-CoV-2  infections. No long-term post-COVID-19 effects were reported. Conclusions: Our  single-centre experience suggests that the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in  children and adolescents with CF is primarily mild and uncomplicated.

We aimed to understand the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk and  assess the impact of inactivated vaccination on the occurrence of reinfection.  We investigated the reinfection risk of SARS-CoV-2 from November 1, 2022, to  February 12, 2023, when China rapidly lifted the zero-COVID policy. The study  subjects were those who were first infected during the zero-COVID period between  January 1, 2020, and October 31, 2022, in Dalian city, China. Among the 1961  previous infections, 126 (6.4%, 95% CI: 5.4, 7.5) were reinfected. The risk of  reinfection increased over time since initial infection. Compared with those who  did not receive or received one dose of inactivated vaccine, receiving two or  three doses was associated with additional protection against reinfection among  individuals who were infected with pre-Omicron more than a year earlier, with  the OR ranged from 0.33 (95% CI: 0.03, 1.83) to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.22, 3.27). In  contrast, no protective effect from two or three doses of vaccines against  reinfection was observed among those who were first infected with Omicron  variants within a year. Primary or booster vaccination contributed to limited  protection against reinfection or symptomatic reinfection among individuals  infected with Omicron SARS-CoV-2 within a year. However, a booster dose after  1 year of natural infection may provide additional protection against  reinfection.  Copyright © 2024 Shihong Yang et al.

BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s social  vulnerability index (SVI) for exploring social and health disparities in the  United States may not be suitable for assessing COVID-19 risk in specific  communities and subpopulations. This study aims to develop the community  vulnerability index (CVI) optimized for demographic-specific COVID-19 prevalence  at the census tract level and apply it to Clark County, Nevada, which includes  the vibrant Las Vegas metropolitan area. METHODS: We constructed the CVI using fifteen social condition variables from  the CDC's SVI along with eight additional community variables measuring inactive  commuting, park deprivation, retail density, low-income homeowner or renter  severe housing cost burden, housing inadequacy, segregation, and population  density. Deploying weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression through a  bootstrapping technique, the CVI was optimized by linking the 23 community  variables to cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 2020 to  November 2021, excluding reinfections. This study resulted in whole-population  and 13 demographic-specific CVIs representative of various age (0-4, 5-17,  18-24, 25-49, 50-64, and 65 +), race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific  Islander, and others), and sex (male and female) groups. RESULTS: All WQS regressions revealed significant associations between the CVIs  and corresponding COVID-19 prevalence. The most influential variables to the  whole-population CVI included minority status, park deprivation, aged 17 and  younger, inactive commuting, and housing inadequacy, which also contributed  significantly to several CVIs corresponding to COVID-19 prevalence in  subpopulations. Other influential community variables to the CVIs in general  varied by subpopulation. The distributions of the subpopulation CVIs showed  different levels of spatial disparities, with the largest disparities observed  in female, White, and age 50-64 groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a practical approach to optimize CVI for  assessing COVID-19 risk. The incorporation of additional variables, specificity  for subpopulations, and adaptability through the WQS regression collectively  contribute to its value in informing evidence-based policy decisions and guiding  targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable  communities.  © 2025.

As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, long COVID emerged as a significant threat to  public health, characterized by one or more persistent symptoms impacting organ  systems beyond 12 weeks of infection. Informative research has been derived from  assessments of long COVID among the Chinese populace. However, none of these  studies considered the COVID-19 experience of Chinese residents in Canada.  Objectives: We aimed to fill this literature gap by delineating the long COVID  experience, prevalence, and associated factors among a sample of Chinese  residing in Canada during the pandemic. Methods: The present study employed a  cross-sectional online survey questionnaire distributed to a sample of Canadian  Chinese using a convenience sampling procedure from 22 December 2022 to 15  February 2023. Respondents were probed for sociodemographic background and  health-, COVID-, and vaccine-related characteristics. Logistic LASSO regression  was used for model building, and multivariate logistic regression was used to  identify factors associated with developing long COVID. Results: Among 491  eligible participants, 63 (12.83%) reported experiencing long COVID with a mean  duration of 5.31 (95% CI: 4.06-6.57) months and major symptoms including  difficulty concentrating (21.67%), pain/discomfort (15.00%), as well as  anxiety/depression (8.33%). Our final model identified significant associations  between long COVID and two or more COVID-19 infections (OR = 23.725, 95% CI:  5.098-110.398, p < 0.0001), very severe/severe symptoms (OR = 3.177, 95% CI:  1.160-8.702, p = 0.0246), over-the-counter medicine (OR = 2.473, 95% CI:  1.035-5.909, p = 0.0416), and traditional Chinese medicine (OR = 8.259, 95% CI:  3.016-22.620, p < 0.0001). Further, we identified a significant protective  effect of very good/good health status (OR = 0.247, 95% CI: 0.112-0.544, p =  0.0005). Conclusions: Long COVID effected a notable proportion of Canadian  Chinese for a prolonged period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings  underscore the importance of preexisting health status and reinfection  prevention when managing long COVID. Moreover, our work indicates an association  between using over-the-counter medicine or traditional Chinese medicine and long  COVID experience among Canadian Chinese.

A deficient vitamin D (VitD) status has been associated with SARS-CoV-2  infections, severity, and mortality. However, this status related to SARS-CoV-2  reinfections has been studied little. Our aim was to quantify the risk of  reinfections considering VitD status before reinfection. METHODS: We performed a population-based prospective cohort study in Borriana  (Valencia Community, Spain) during 2020-2023, measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D  [25(OH)D] levels by electrochemiluminescence. Cox proportional hazards models  were employed. RESULTS: Of a total of 644 SARS-CoV-2 cases with confirmed laboratory tests, 378  (58.9%) were included in our study, with an average age of 38.8 years; 241 were  females (63.8%), and 127 reinfections occurred (33.6%). SARS-CoV-2 reinfection  incidence rates per 1000 person-days by VitD status were 0.50 for a deficient  status (<20 ng/mL), 0.50 for an insufficient status (20-29 ng/mL), and 0.37 for  a sufficient status (≥30 ng/mL). Compared with a sufficient VitD status,  adjusted hazard ratios were 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-3.59) for a  deficient status and 1.59 (95% CI 1.06-2.38) for an insufficient status with a  significant inverse dose-response (p = 0.02). These results can help improve  nutritional actions against SARS-CoV-2 reinfections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a VitD status lower than 30 ng/mL showed  a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Achieving and maintaining a sufficient  VitD status is recommended to prevent reinfections.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Since long COVID has hindered people from normal life, it is  essential to understand its full spectrum of manifestation. However, it was  heterogeneous in the existing studies and few large-scale studies have been  conducted on Asian populations. Here, we conducted a multi-centre  questionnaire-based study among Chinese people to explore the long COVID based  on the definition of WHO. METHODS: During March 20, 2023 and June 18, 2023, individuals with a history of  confirmed or self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited from three  hospitals to fill out the questionnaire for long COVID. Each symptom was  assigned with 0 to 3 points based on their severity. And the long COVID score  was a sum of these points of each symptom. The reporting rate, time trend and  risk factors of long COVID stratified by different systems were explored. RESULTS: 3,693 individuals were recruited for the study. The reporting rate of  at least one persistent long COVID symptoms and symptoms impacting daily life  was 30.2% (1,117) and 10.7% (394). Systemic symptoms (20.7%, 765) were most  easily reported. The most common symptoms were fatigue (16.3%, 602), cough  (6.3%, 234) and expectoration (5.5%, 203). The reporting rate of long COVID and  long COVID score decreased over time during a 180-day follow-up period  (P < 0.05). For long COVID, older age (OR: 1.63, 1.38-1.93), female (OR: 1.19,  1.03-1.38) and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (OR: 3.56, 2.63-4.80) were risk factors;  while number of COVID-19 vaccine doses (OR: 0.87, 0.81-0.94) was a protective  factor. The use of traditional Chinese medicine (OR: 0.51, 0.37-0.71) was a  protective factor for symptoms impacting daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Early interventions should be taken to minimize the impact of long  COVID, especially for the elderly, females and those with SARS-CoV-2  reinfection. COVID-19 booster vaccination might play a potential role in  minimizing the impact of long COVID.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Coinfections and reactivation of persistent or latent viral  infections such as herpesviruses (HHV) and/or measles virus (MeV) have been  reported among COVID-19 patients. However, there is limited information  regarding cancer patients who experienced severe acute respiratory syndrome  corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary purpose of this study was to  investigate the interplay between SARS-CoV-2, HHV and MeV in cancer patients,  aiming to provide insights into the pathophysiology of these infections and to  enhance the patients' health outcomes. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 4 groups (n = 147):  newly diagnosed cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 37), newly  diagnosed cancer patients non-infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 13), apparently  normal individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 82) and finally a normal  control group (n = 15). All samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using  the real-rime quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  (qRT-PCR). Antibody responses were analyzed using indirect enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibody levels were compared between patients  and controls. Potential re-activation was investigated using fourfold (i.e.  400%) rise model criterion. RESULTS: In all positive cases of SARS-CoV-2, recent infections or re-infection  of herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV1/2 or HHV1-2) were found to be  significantly increased approximately three-fold higher in COVID-19 patients  (p = 0.007) identified via pooled HSV1/2 IgM levels in plasma. Furthermore,  reactivation of HSV1/2 was 29.7% in cancer/COVID-19 patients (n = 37) versus  0.0% of normal/COVID-19 group (n = 22) (p = 0.008). Likewise, Epstein-Barr  Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1) IgG levels showed a ≥ fourfold increase in 20%  (p = 0.034) of cancer patients (n = 50) versus 4.9% of controls (n = 41) for  reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4). Obviously, MeV IgG levels  increased up to 78.0% in cancer patients (n = 50) versus 17.5% in non-cancerous  group (n = 40, p < 0.001). Reactivation of MeV in cancer and COVID-19 patients  was 43.2% versus 30.8% cancer non-COVID-19 group, 3.3% normal COVID-19, and 0.0%  in healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were at increased risk of  HHV and MeV co-infection and reactivation.  © 2025. The Author(s).

IMPORTANCE: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) remains a major  public health challenge. While previous studies have focused on characterizing  PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an  initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant  reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study  investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase  in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and  conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the  pediatric population. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data from  the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 children's hospitals and health  institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023. EXPOSURES: A second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive  polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19,  occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial  infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: PASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the  ICD-10-CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24  physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC  were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second  infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified  Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare  utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching. RESULTS: A total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17  [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second  infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC  diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many  specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86);  changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and  thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI,  1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and  electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95%  CI, 1.48 to ; arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme  (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to ; fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to  1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain  (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes  (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR,  1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95%  CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems,  including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and  musculoskeletal systems. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children and adolescents face significantly higher  risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings  suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted  prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased  emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

This study aimed to understand the acute and post-acute burden of SARS-CoV-2  infection and to identify high-risk groups for post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). METHODS: A retrospective observational study of the Bahraini population was  conducted between 1 May 2021 and 30 April 2023, utilizing the national  administrative database. PCC cases were defined according to WHO guidelines. All  COVID-19 cases were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Of 13,067 COVID-19 cases, 12,022 of them experienced acute COVID-19,  and 1,045 of them developed PCC. Individuals with PCC tended to be older women  with risk factors and instances of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. The incidence rates  per 100,000 individuals during the Alpha pandemic surge (2020), Delta pandemic  surge (2021), and Omicron pandemic surge (2022) were 2.2, 137.2, and 222.5 for  acute COVID-19, and 0.27, 10.5, and 19.3, respectively, for PCC cases. The death  rates per 100,000 individuals during the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron pandemic  surges were 3, 112, and 76, respectively, for acute COVID-19 and 1, 10, and 8,  respectively, for PCC. The death rate was highest among those aged 65 and older  during the Delta pandemic surge. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the need for a timely national vaccination  program prior to new COVID-19 surges to prevent complications related to  SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the older adult and in non-older adult  individuals with risk factors.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cancer represents an important risk factor for acquiring  severe acute respiratory syndrome by Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent  hospitalization. The utility of early antiviral therapies, including their  protective effect on long COVID outcomes, in cancer patients has not yet been  clearly demonstrated. We conducted the CO.THER study (COVID-19 THErapies in  patients with canceR) to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: We designed an ambispective single-center cohort study. We collected  clinical and oncological data from the hospital's electronic patient records at  the start of COVID-19 therapy (T0), seven days after T0 (T1), two weeks after T0  (T2), one month after T0 (T3), three months after T0 (T4), six months after T0  (T5), and twelve months after T0 (T6). The primary endpoint of this ambispective  single-center cohort study was the rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 disease  within 14 days in cancer patients using anti-SARS-CoV-2 early therapies. The  proportion of hospitalizations within 14 days (primary endpoint) was computed  together with its exact binomial 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: 131 patients' records (53M [40.5%], 78F, [59.5%]; median age 62.45,  interquartile range [IQR] 56-71) were enrolled. As shown by the Kaplan-Meier  hospitalization-free estimate, only three patients (2.1%) were hospitalized for  a COVID-19 related cause within 14 days of starting early treatment (95%CI  0.5-6.6%). The cumulative survival probability beyond 12 months in  hospitalization-free patients was 98% (95%CI 93-99%). Twelve patients (9.2%)  reported another COVID-19 infection during the follow-up and they were all  retreated with Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir. The cumulative reinfection-free survival  was 90% at 12 months (95%CI 83-95%). Further, 15 patients of the 123 evaluable  at 3 months (median age 51 years, IQR 40-68) reported long COVID symptoms  (12.2%, 95%CI 7.0-19.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a low rate of hospitalization and reassuring  data on safety in this cohort of high-risk subjects.

Cardiac conditions are a significant category of post-COVID conditions. The  objective of this study was to synthesise the evidence on the factors associated  with the development of post-COVID cardiac conditions, the frequency of clinical  outcomes in affected patients, and the potential prognostic factors. A  systematic review was conducted using the databases EBSCOhost, MEDLINE via  PubMed, BVS, and Embase, covering studies from 2019 to December 2023. A total of  8343 articles were identified, and seven met the eligibility criteria for data  extraction. The protective effect of vaccination stood out among the associated  factors, showing a reduced risk of developing post-COVID cardiac conditions.  Conversely, COVID-19 reinfections were associated with an increased risk of  cardiovascular outcomes. Regarding the main outcomes in these patients, most  recovered, although some cases persisted beyond 200 days of follow-up. The study  included in the analysis of prognostic factors reported that the four children  who did not recover by the end of the study were between two and five years old  and had gastrointestinal symptoms during the illness. The COVID-19 vaccination  regimen reduces the risk of developing post-COVID cardiac conditions. Public  health policies promoting immunisation should be encouraged to prevent  SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world, and the duration of  protective immunity against the virus remains unknown. Evidence suggests that  patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection may experience reinfection. The aim  of this study is to determine the relationship between COVID-19 reinfection and  previous infection history in the population covered by Mashhad University of  Medical Sciences. METHODS: This population-based, historical cohort study included all individuals  with health records at the health service centers of Mashhad University of  Medical Sciences who underwent PCR testing during the study period (April 1,  2020, up to February 19, 2022). The data were analyzed by calculating the  infection rate in both PCR-positive and negative individuals, and estimating the  adjusted rate ratio using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The results of this study in the entire population showed that the  incidence rate in people with a history of primary COVID-19 infection was 13%  higher than that in people who had no history of this disease. However, in the  group that received the vaccine prior to the first PCR test, the incidence rate  was lower among individuals with a positive first test result (IRR =  0.71)  compared to those with a negative first test result. CONCLUSION: The study reveals that prior COVID-19 infection does not ensure  immunity and may increase the risk of reinfection, particularly among men and  younger individuals. Vaccination appears to complicate this dynamic, as those  with multiple vaccine doses showed higher reinfection rates compared to those  with fewer doses. These findings highlight the need for ongoing research and  tailored public health strategies to address the complexities of COVID-19  immunity and reinfection.  Copyright: © 2025 Nikbakht et al.

The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection persist months and years after recovery. We conducted an online survey  to assess the health condition of convalescents approximately 5 months following  the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2. The study recruited 5,510 individuals who  were primary infected, 626 participants who had experienced reinfection, and 521  participants who were without infective history. The most common disorders after  the primary infection group were fatigue (15.18 %), memory issue (13.13 %),  post-exertional malaise (PEM, 11.68 %), and brain fog (11.29 %) at the time of  survey. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection had an impact on the reproductive  systems. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, smoking currently, with  background diseases, and outpatient visits in the acute phase could be  associated with moderate / severe disorders. Further analysis of different  background diseases showed that allergic rhinitis, hyperlipidemia,  cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases, and asthma  likely increased the risk of moderate/severe disorders. The probability of  developing disorders of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was higher  before the secondary infection than uninfected people. Fatigue, PEM, muscle  pain/spasms, chills, joint pain, excessive sweating at rest, headache /  dizziness, sore throat or foreign body sensation in the throat, cough,  expectoration, dry / painful / watery eyes, loss of appetite and constipation  were associated with an increased risk of reinfection. It was essential to  undertake further research with enhanced randomization in a larger sample in the  community, and to strengthen the validation of the research conclusions. The  findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the health  recovery process among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents.  Moreover, the findings help identify characteristic health risk factors  associated with convalescents and highlight the risk of moderate / severe  disorders and reinfection. Furthermore, the findings also provide valuable  guidance and reference for SARS-CoV-2 rehabilitation strategies and the  prevention of reinfection, offering insights for scientific recommendations.  © 2024 Chinese Medical Association Publishing House.

This study aimed to derive meaningful SARS-CoV-2 reinfected  patients' phenotypes based on easily-available patient data and explore key  epidemiological factors of reinfections. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 reinfected  adults from the Basque Country between January 1, 2021 and January 9, 2022.  Phenotypes were defined in an unsupervised manner with clustering algorithms,  incorporating variables like age, Charlson score, vaccination status and  pre-existing treatments and comorbidities. Subsequently, clinical  characteristics of phenotypes were compared, and their behavioral differences  were evaluated through generalized additive models. Finally, their association  with clinical outcomes was assessed. RESULTS: Four phenotypes were identified, which subsequently had a direct  relationship with the risk levels for severe COVID-19 outcomes. The highest-risk  group, phenotype 4, consisted of older adults -76 years, [62-85] (Median,  [Interquartile range])- with multiple comorbidities and extensive baseline  medication use. Phenotype 3 was slightly younger -64 years, [58-77]- but  presented very low Charlson scores and few comorbidities, representing an  intermediate-risk group. Phenotypes 1 and 2 were younger and healthier adults  with similar clinical profiles. However, phenotype 1 showed a less protective  attitude, with a higher rate of unvaccinated patients and shorter time intervals  between infections. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to classify reinfected patients into four distinct  groups based on easily available variables, and these phenotypes had a direct  relationship with COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Thus, rapidly phenotyping infected  individuals can serve as a preventive public health strategy during new  pandemics.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Despite completing the COVID-19 vaccination series, healthcare  workers (HCWs) remain at an elevated risk of re-infection. Booster uptake,  though essential for this group, remains poorly characterized among Bangladeshi  HCWs. This study identified the prevalence and driving factors behind booster  hesitancy among Bangladeshi HCWs, providing valuable insights for targeted  interventions. METHOD: From December 2022 to June 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional survey  among 1772 HCWs enrolled from 20 healthcare facilities of all tiers purposively  selected across four administrative divisions of Bangladesh. We collected  information through face-to-face interviews regarding their sociodemographic,  pre-existing, and currently existing medical conditions, COVID-19 vaccination  status, and their intention, hesitancy, and willingness to receive future  booster doses. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze  factors associated with booster hesitancy. Odd's ratio with 95% confidence  intervals (CIs) was calculated for each factor, with p < 0.05 considered  statistically significant. RESULT: Of the 1772 HCWs interviewed in our study, 49% (879) were nurses [median  age 36 years (IQR: 30.0-46.0)]; 69% were female. Among the respondents, 94%  (1667) were willing to take a booster, and 6% (105) showed hesitancy. Safety  concerns, especially regarding potential side effects post-booster  administration (86%), emerged as the leading cause of booster hesitancy among  healthcare workers. Our multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that  support staff, compared to physicians, were the most hesitant to receive any  additional booster dose (aOR 4.68, 95% CI: 1.56-9.03; p=0.006). Compared to  rural residency, HCWs with an urban residency type were also more reluctant to  receive booster doses (aOR 4.45, 95% CI: 2.03-9.73; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Concerns about side effects following booster administration were  the primary driver of hesitancy in our study. Targeted interventions focusing on  education and addressing these anxieties-supported by evidence-based  communication strategies-could play a crucial role in improving booster  acceptance and safeguarding this vulnerable workforce.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and  neonatal outcomes and immunity in pregnant women in China. METHODS: 283 pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the prospective  observational cohort study and divided into five groups based on infection  stage. Antibody levels were measured in plasma, umbilical cord blood, and breast  milk, and combined with clinical data and 6-month follow-up results. We measured  SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels using a chemiluminescence immunoassay and analyzed  the data with the Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in age, BMI, weight change during  pregnancy, or the incidence of gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes,  gestational hypothyroidism, intrahepatic cholestasis, transaminitis, preterm  birth, small for gestational age, neonatal NICU transfers, developmental delays,  and hearing damage among the five groups. The incidence of COVID-19 in infants  from mothers infected at different stages of pregnancy was significantly lower  than in the uninfected group (P < 0.05). Maternal and umbilical cord blood  showed significantly higher IgG levels in the infected group compared to the  uninfected group at different stages of pregnancy (P < 0.05). The median  transplacental antibody transfer ratio across all infection groups was 1.15  (0.98-1.30), with no significant differences between them. The reinfection group  had significantly higher IgA levels during pregnancy compared to other groups  (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: No adverse outcomes were observed in mothers or infants at any stage  of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibodies in umbilical cord blood and breast  milk may offer passive immunity to newborns for 1-3 months. Reinfection during  pregnancy may extend this immunity without raising the risk of adverse outcomes.  © 2025. The Author(s).

People experiencing homelessness are at elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection,  yet estimates generally exclude re-infections and rely on data sources affected  by testing policies or study timing. In this prospective cohort study, we report  incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and re-infections over time using a  combination of community-based and study-administered testing, and assessed  individual and housing-related factors associated with new infection.  Individuals experiencing homelessness were randomly selected from 62 sites  across Toronto, Canada, between June and September 2021. Participants provided  detailed surveys and biological samples to test for SARS-CoV-2 (by RT-PCR and  ELISA) every three months for one year. Self-reported data were verified and  augmented through linkage to health administrative databases. Among 640  participants who completed 2,401 interviews, we identified 613 SARS-CoV-2  infection events, representing an incidence rate of 35.3 infections/100-person  years (95% CI 31.6-39.4) prior to the onset of Omicron and 97.2 infections/100  person-years (95% CI 86.8-108.8) after Omicron. Nearly 30% (n = 182) of these  events were re-infections. In multivariable models, post-Omicron interviews  (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 3.54 [95% CI 3.12-4.02]), history of prior COVID-19  infection (1 infection aRR 2.55 [95% CI 2.29-2.83]; 2 + infections aRR 2.28 [95%  CI 1.80-2.89]) and residing in high- or moderate-exposure risk (congregate and  shared) housing settings (high-exposure aRR 1.74 [95% CI 1.43-2.11];  moderate-exposure aRR 1.39 [1.15-1.68]) were most significantly associated with  new infection. Our findings highlight that existing reports significantly  underestimate SARS-CoV-2 infection burden among people experiencing  homelessness, but confirms previously reported factors associated with  infection, including congregate and shared housing settings. Reducing reliance  on overcrowded emergency housing is necessary to reduce infection incidence in  this population as well as associated inequities in downstream acute and chronic  complications.

(#)Contributed equally  INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection is associated with post-acute adverse outcomes  affecting multiple organ systems. Although preliminary studies have suggested  that COVID-19 re-infection may have a cumulative effect on long-term outcome,  differential effects of COVID-19 re-infection severe enough to be hospitalised  on post-acute sequelae compared with hospitalised first-time infection have not  been explored. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using territory-wide electronic medical  records databases in Hong Kong. Adults hospitalised with COVID-19 between 1  January and 30 November 2022, who survived the first 28 days after infection and  was discharged, were categorised into re-infection and first-time infection  groups. Individuals with reinfection were compared with those with first-time  infection for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospital readmission, attendance to  the emergency department and complications during the post-acute period using  propensity-score-weighted Cox regression. Subgroup analyses were conducted by  age (<65 and ≥65 years), sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (0-4, ≥5), COVID-19  vaccination (0-1, 2+doses) and hospitalisation status of previous infection. RESULTS: 2244 patients with hospitalised COVID-19 re-infection and 58 894  patients with hospitalised first-time COVID-19 infection were included. After a  median follow-up of 170 days, re-infection was associated with a significantly  higher risk of post-acute all-cause mortality compared with first-time infection  (adjusted HR (95% CI): 1.366 (1.166 to 1.600); incidence rate (95% CI): 7.3 (7.1  to 7.5) vs 4.6 (4.4 to 4.7) per 10 000 person-days), all-cause hospital  readmission (1.297 (1.200 to 1.403); 50.5 (49.8 to 51.1) vs 28.1 (27.8 to  28.5)), and attendance to emergency departments (1.307 (1.199 to 1.425); 35.4  (34.8 to 35.9) vs 21.9 (21.6 to 22.2)). Findings were consistent across  subgroups of age, sex, health status and vaccination status. A greater magnitude  of increased risk was observed especially among those hospitalised during a  previous infection. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalisation,  COVID-19 re-infection was associated with increased post-acute mortality and  morbidity compared with first-time infection. Further studies are warranted to  delineate the effects on complications.  Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. Re-use permitted under CC  BY-NC. Published by BMJ Group.

The mechanisms by which this occurs and consequences for  cross-variant protection against evolving pathogens remain incompletely  understood, particularly in the context of immunosuppressive treatments used in  patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). METHODS: To investigate this, we characterised longitudinal changes in the  anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody repertoire over the course of three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA  vaccinations in patients with IMIDs treated with methotrexate (MTX) and/or  tumour necrosis factor-inhibitors (TNFi), anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, no  systemic therapy, and healthy controls (total N = 878). We determined serum  antibody titres against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Wuhan-Hu-1 (WH1)  and Omicron BA.1 spike proteins, and assessed ratios thereof between groups as a  proxy for cross-reactivity. FINDINGS: We observe emerging anti-BA.1 RBD reactivity over time, notably  following a third vaccination. This may be partly explained by affinity  maturation, as evaluated by inhibition of ACE2-RBD interactions. Similar trends  were seen in patients treated with MTX and/or TNFi, but not in patients on  anti-CD20 therapy. SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination accelerated these  effects initially while leading to comparable results after three vaccinations. INTERPRETATION: MTX and TNFi do not qualitatively alter the evolution of the  antibody repertoire in response to repeated antigen exposure, whereas anti-CD20  does. These insights may help to optimise vaccination strategies for patients  with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Background and Objectives: Brain fog, characterized by cognitive difficulties  such as memory impairment, lack of focus, and mental fatigue, is a common  symptom reported during recovery from COVID-19, particularly in long COVID  cases. This study explores potential triggers such as sleep quality, mood, and  gastrointestinal health and examines the link between adherence to the MIND diet  and brain fog severity. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was  conducted between 1 July and 15 December 2022. The questionnaire assessed brain  fog symptoms, dietary habits, sleep quality, mood, and gastrointestinal  symptoms. Linear regression analysis examined the relationships between brain  fog symptoms, demographic factors, sleep quality, MIND diet adherence, and  gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: Brain Fog Scale (BFS) scores were  significantly higher in individuals who had COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and even higher  in those with reinfection. Women had higher BFS and Brain Fog Severity Score  (BFSS), MIND Diet, The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Brief Mood  Introspection Scale (BMIS) Pleasant-Unpleasant scores (p < 0.05). BFS and BFSS  were positively correlated with GSRS (p < 0.05), while no correlation was found  with MIND diet adherence. A negative correlation was observed between BFS and  Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) (p < 0.05), but this was not significant in regression  (p = 0.367). GSRS, Pleasant-Unpleasant Dimension, and Arousal-Calm Dimension  were significant predictors of BFS (R = 0.599, R2 = 0.358, p < 0.01).  Conclusions: This study identifies being female as a risk factor for brain fog  symptoms, with women reporting higher BFS and BFSS scores. While sleep quality  showed a negative correlation with brain fog symptoms, this relationship was not  significant in the regression model, suggesting that other factors, such as mood  and gastrointestinal symptoms, may play a more dominant role. However, adherence  to the MIND diet showed no significant relationship with brain fog symptoms.  These findings suggest that addressing mood and gastrointestinal health may be  key to managing brain fog in long COVID.

A 66-year-old female, a known case of endometrial serous carcinoma, presented  with a history of poor oral intake. Elevated C-reactive protein was identified,  and an echocardiogram showed evidence of large circumferential pericardial fluid  with maximum diameter measuring 4.4 cm. Further analysis of the pericardial  fluid revealed growth of Candida krusei. Treatment was initiated with  caspofungin 150mg intravenously once daily for 28 days, followed by oral  maintenance therapy with voriconazole for 10 days. No relapse or re-infection  was observed during 10 days of follow-up. A literature search was performed,  which demonstrated that Candida albicans is the most encountered Candida spp.  associated with acute pericarditis. Additionally, the following risk factors  were observed, including history of major surgery, COVID-19 infection, and use  of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This article presents a unique case of acute  pericarditis caused by C. krusei. It highlights the importance of identifying  the etiology in immunocompromised cohorts and emphasizes the role of  establishing formative treatment guidelines for the management of Candida spp.  pericarditis.

Numerous studies have investigated vaccine-induced correlates of protection  (CoP) against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection, but data on infection-induced CoP are limited. Given differences  between vaccine- and infection-induced immune responses, in conjunction with low  vaccination in many US populations, a better understanding of infection-induced  CoP is needed. We used residual sera from a mid-2020 Rhode Island serosurvey of  healthcare professionals (HCP) and corresponding state-collected SARS-CoV-2  testing data through February 2021 to generate an analytic cohort of HCP with a  first SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to serosurvey blood collection and multiple  viral tests after blood collection to assess for reinfection (defined as a  positive viral test ≥90 days after their first positive). We tested sera for  levels of IgG and IgA targeting ancestral spike (S), receptor-binding domain  (RBD), or nucleocapsid (N). We used adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios to  assess the association between categorical antibody level and the risk of  subsequent reinfection. Among 170 HCP included in this analysis (median age = 47  years; interquartile range: 35-55 years), 30 were reinfected during the analytic  period. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios indicated that higher levels of  anti-S or anti-RBD IgG were significantly associated with a lower risk of  reinfection. These findings support the use of anti-S or anti-RBD IgG levels as  markers of immunologic protection, such as in population serosurveys, or  immune-bridging studies in settings of high prevalence of prior  infection.  IMPORTANCEThe measurement of antibodies in blood is a relatively  simple process and commonly used to estimate overall levels of past infection in  populations. But, if someone has antibodies, does this mean that they are  protected from being infected again? And are people with higher levels of  antibody better protected? There are good data in the literature exploring how  antibodies from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination are  associated with protection. But, there is still a lot to learn about protection  conferred by antibodies that develop after a severe acute respiratory  syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In our study, we measure the  levels of six different antibody types developed after infection and compare  levels to the risk of subsequent infection to better understand which antibody  types are best associated with protection. Our data are important for improving  studies that use antibodies as proxies for protection, such as population  immunity estimates, or those assessing new prevention products.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: To investigate the symptoms, the level of antibody, the progression  of liver disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged and elderly  population infected with hepatitis virus. METHODS: The study was based on a cohort of high-risk liver cancer and the  participants was recruited in April 2023. Blood sample were collected and  information was obtained through questionnaires. Data on reinfection was  obtained by follow-up until July 31, 2023. The SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing  antibody and IgG were measured. RESULTS: A total of 599 participants infected with hepatitis virus were included  and the mean age was 61.3 ± 7.4 years. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was 94.7%.  Among the infected, 132 were asymptomatic, 435 were symptomatic, no severe cases  occurred. Four months after infection, no difference was in liver function and  aMAP score between the infected and uninfected. The infected had higher  seropositivity rates of both antibodies than the uninfected (neutralizing  antibody: uninfected: 93.7%, infected: 99.6%; IgG: uninfected: 59.4%, infected:  98.9%). The levels of both antibodies in the symptomatic were higher than those  the asymptomatic and the uninfected (neutralizing antibody: uninfected: 0.75  AU/mL, asymptomatic: 15.46 AU/mL, symptomatic: 24.76 AU/mL; IgG: uninfected:  15.10 AU/mL, asymptomatic: 263.84 AU/mL, symptomatic: 291.83 AU/mL). By July 31,  2023, the incidence of reinfection was 17.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was high, no severe cases  occurred. Omicron infection may not aggravate progression of hepatitis. Four  months after infection, the population showed high positivity rate in  neutralizing antibody and IgG. Monitoring of virus mutations and targeted  prevention and care strategies is crucial for vulnerable populations.  ©2025 Pan et al.

Awakoaiye B(1), Dangi T(1), Penaloza-MacMaster P(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine,  Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.  SARS-CoV-2 has infected a large fraction of the human population. Currently,  most individuals have developed immunity either through vaccination or natural  infection. Despite this, SARS-CoV-2 booster immunizations are still recommended  to reduce the risk of reinfections, but there is still limited understanding on  how different booster vaccine platforms influence antibody responses. We  conducted immunological studies in mice to evaluate the boosting effects of  different vaccine platforms on antibody responses. C57BL/6 mice were first  primed with an adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2  spike protein. The mice were then boosted with the same Ad5-based vaccine  (homologous boosting) or with a protein-based vaccine (heterologous boosting).  Interestingly, the heterologous regimen (Ad5 prime + protein boost) elicited  superior antibody responses, relative to the homologous regimen (Ad5 prime + Ad5  boost). Similar potentiation of antibody responses was reported when mice were  primed with poxvirus or rhabdovirus vectors and then boosted with protein. These  findings highlight a potential advantage of protein booster immunizations to  potentiate humoral immunity.

IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of COVID-19  vaccines in children and adolescents. However, the benefits of vaccination in  these age groups with prior infection remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing  reinfection with various Omicron subvariants (BA.1/2, BA.4/5, XBB, and later)  among 5- to 17-year-olds with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: A target trial emulation through nested designs with distinct study  periods. SETTING: The study utilized data from the Research COVID to Enhance Recovery  (RECOVER) initiative, a national electronic health record (EHR) database  comprising 37 U.S. children's hospitals and health institutions. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 5-17 years with a documented history of  SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the study start date during a specific  variant-dominant period (Delta, BA.1/2, or BA.4/5) who received a subsequent  dose of COVID-19 vaccine during the study periods were compared with those with  a documented history of infection who did not receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during  the study period. Those infected within the Delta-Omicron composite period  (December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021) were excluded. The study period was  from January 1, 2022, to August 30, 2023, and focused on adolescents aged 12 to  17 years and children aged 5 to 11 years. EXPOSURES: At least received one COVID-19 vaccination during the study period  vs. no receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome is documented SARS-CoV-2  reinfection during the study period (both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases).  The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine was estimated as (1- hazard ratio)  *100%, with confounders adjusted by a combination of propensity score matching  and exact matching. RESULTS: The study analyzed 87,573 participants during the BA.1/2 period,  229,326 during the BA.4/5 period, and 282,981 during the XBB or later period.  Among vaccinated individuals, significant protection was observed during the  BA.1/2 period, with effectiveness rates of 62% (95% CI: 38%-77%) for children  and 65% (95% CI: 32%-81%) for adolescents. During the BA.4/5 period, vaccine  effectiveness was 57% (95% CI: 25%-76%) for children, but not statistically  significant for adolescents (36%, 95% CI: -16%-65%). For the XBB period, no  significant protection was observed in either group, with effectiveness rates of  22% (95% CI: -36%-56%) in children and 34% (95% CI: -10%-61%) in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 vaccination provides significant protection  against reinfection for children and adolescents with prior infections during  the early and mid-Omicron periods. This study also highlights the importance of  addressing low vaccination rates in pediatric populations to enhance protection  against emerging variants.

OBJECTIVE: Since the lifting of the COVID-19 restrictions in China in November  2022, there has been a notable surge in the COVID-19 infection rate. Little is  known about the prevalence of long COVID among the general adult population and  its impact on COVID-19-related worries and behaviors after the policy change. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 1530 adults with prior COVID-19  infection in Guangzhou from February to March 2023. Logistic regression analyses  and trend analyses were performed to investigate the associations between long  COVID- and COVID-19-related worries and preventive behaviors. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of long COVID among adults in China was 18.0%  (95% confidence interval: 16.1% to 20.0%). Common long COVID symptoms included  cough (60.7%), fatigue (47.6%), dyspnea (34.5%), palpitation (26.2%), and  insomnia (25.1%). Adjusted for background variables, individuals with long COVID  exhibited higher level of COVID-19-related worries compared to those who had  fully recovered from the infection (reference: without long COVID; adjusted odds  ratios ranged from 1.87 to 2.55, all p values < 0.001). Participants primarily  expressed worries regarding the potential for COVID-19 reinfection, the impact  of the pandemic on daily life, the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and  deaths, and the capacity of the healthcare system. While long COVID did not  statistically significantly affect their preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID was prevalent among the general adult population in  China after lifting the COVID-19 restrictions, and it had a significant impact  on COVID-19-related worries. This study highlights the importance of monitoring  the mental health of individuals with long COVID and developing targeted  intervention strategies to improve their adherence to preventive measures.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and factors  associated with in-hospital transmission rates among healthcare workers (HCW) is  crucial for their protection. Brazil experienced high mortality rates due to  COVID-19, and limited data are available on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection  among HCW. This cohort study aimed to assess the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2  infections in HCW from two tertiary hospitals in central Brazil, one of them a  Reference Hospital for COVID-19. METHODS: From May 2020 to January 2021, 554 HCW directly involved with COVID-19  care were followed through 12 biweekly visits. During these visits, blood,  nasal, and oropharyngeal samples were collected, and participants underwent  interviews. SARS-CoV-2 detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, while the  assessment of seroprevalence was based on IgG detection. Additionally, 35  positive samples underwent viral whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: The infection prevalence, as per RT-qPCR, was 28.5% (24.9-32.4),  reflecting an overall attack rate ranging from 0.5% to 9.5%, marked by two peaks  in August and December 2020. Oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic infections  accounted for 14% of prevalent infections. The seroprevalence rate stood at  25.8%. The hospitalization rate was 8.2%, with a fatality rate of 1.3%. Risk  factors associated with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 included being male,  working at the referral hospital, having a graduate-education level, and using  hydroxychloroquine and zinc for prevention or treatment. One reinfection was  identified. Absenteeism was 56.6%. The infection dynamics mirrored the pattern  observed in the general population. CONCLUSION: One-third of the professionals in the followed cohort were infected.  Being male, working in a COVID-19 referral center, having a low level of  education, and using medications for preventive treatment represented risk  factors. Healthcare workers at the COVID-19 referral hospital exhibited a higher  incidence rate compared to those at the non-referral hospital, increasing the  plausibility that some of the infections occur in the hospital environment.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVES: Predictions regarding the on-going burden of SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine  recommendations, require an understanding of infection-associated immune  protection. We assessed whether early COVID-19 provided protection against  Omicron infection. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of adults in Ontario, Canada, with COVID-19 prior  to October 2020 (early infection, EI), and a matched cohort with COVID-19  testing and a negative PCR (non-EI). Participants completed baseline surveys  then surveys every two weeks until January 2023. Multivariable Cox regression  was used to assess factors associated with COVID-19 infection during the first  14 months of Omicron. RESULTS: Overall, 624 EI (70%) and 175 (77%) non-EI participants met criteria  for analysis; 590 (95%) EI and 164 (94%) non-EI had received at least 2 COVID-19  vaccine doses prior to Omicron. Of 624 EI, 175 (28%) had one SARS-CoV-2  re-infection and 8 (1.3%) had two, compared to 84 (48%) non-EI participants with  one, 5 (2.9%) with two and 1 (0.6%) with 3 infections (P < 0.0001). In  multivariable analysis of risk factors for Omicron infection, the overall hazard  ratio (HR, 95%CI) associated with EI was 0.56 (0.43-0.74); HRs for BA.1/2,  BA.4/5 and mixed BA.5/BQ.1/XBB periods were 0.66 (0.45-0.97), 0.44 (0.28-0.68)  and 0.71 (0.32-1.56). EI and BA.1/2 infection combined reduced later Omicron  infection (HR 0.07 (0.03-0.21) compared to no prior infection. Older age,  non-White ethnicity, no children in household, and lower neighbourhood income  were associated with reduced risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In our highly vaccinated population, early SARS-CoV-2 infection was  associated with a 44% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 during the first 14  months of Omicron, providing significant protection against re-infection for  more than 2 years.  © 2025.

Lin W(1), Kung KH(1), Chan CL(1), Chuang SK(1), Au KW(1).  Author information: (1)Communicable Disease Branch, Centre for Health Protection, Department of  Health, Hong Kong.  We aimed to identify risk factors related to COVID-19 reinfection in Hong Kong.  We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study and reviewed  case-based data on COVID-19 infections reported to the Centre for Health  Protection from 8 January 2020 to 29 January 2023. We analyzed the epidemiology  of COVID-19 infections and performed a Cox regression analysis. In this period,  3.32% (103,065/3,106,579) of COVID-19 infections recorded were classified as  reinfection. Compared with primarily infected cases, a higher proportion of  re-infected cases had chronic diseases (33.54% vs. 27.27%) and were residents of  residential care homes (RCH) (10.99% vs. 1.41%). The time interval between the  two episodes ranged from 31 to 1,050 days (median 282 days). Cox regression  analysis of Omicron cases with the adjustment of covariates showed that being  female (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.11-1.13), chronic diseases (HR 1.18,  95% CI 1.16-1.20) and RCH residents (HR 6.78, 95% CI 6.61-6.95) were associated  with reinfection, while additional vaccination after primary infection was  protective (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.79-0.81). Further analytical studies on the risk  factors and protectors of COVID-19 reinfection are needed to guide targeted  interventions.

BACKGROUND: Our previous systematic review estimated the cumulative incidence of  SARS-CoV-2 reinfections as 1.16% (95% CI = 1.01-1.33%) during the pre-Omicron  period. The Omicron variant that emerged in November 2021 was significantly  genetically distinct from the previous SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus, more  transmissible and posed an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections in the  population. We, therefore, conducted a fresh systematic review and meta-analysis  to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 reinfection burden during the Omicron period. METHODS: We searched CINAHL, Medline, Global Health, Embase, and WHO COVID-19 in  October 2023 for studies reporting the SARS-CoV-2 reinfection incidence during  the Omicron period. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the  Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted  to estimate the incidence, and requirement of hospitalisation of SARS-CoV-2  reinfections. Symptomatic severity of reinfections and case fatality rates were  analysed narratively. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included. The reinfection cumulative incidence  during the Omicron period was 3.35% (95% CI = 1.95-5.72%) based on data from 28  studies. The cumulative incidence was higher in 18-59-year-old adults (6.62%  (95% CI = 3.22-13.12%)) compared to other age groups and in health care workers  (9.88% (95% CI = 5.18-18.03%)) compared to the general population (2.48% (95%  CI = 1.34-4.54%)). We estimated about 1.81% (95% CI = 0.18-15.87%) of the  reinfected cases required hospitalisation based on limited and highly variable  data. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased risk of reinfections during the Omicron  period compared to the pre-Omicron period. The incidence was higher in  18-59-year-old adults and health care workers and generally less severe during  the Omicron period. However, data were limited on disease severity and long-term  outcomes. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42023482598.  Copyright © 2025 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.

Simulation-based validation of a method to detect changes in SARS-CoV-2  reinfection risk.  Lombard B(1), Moultrie H(2), Pulliam JRC(1), van Schalkwyk C(1).

(2)Division of the National Health Laboratory Service, National Institute for  Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.  Given the high global seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the risk of  reinfection has become increasingly important. Models developed to track trends  in reinfection risk should be robust against possible biases arising from  imperfect data observation processes. We performed simulation-based validation  of an existing catalytic model designed to detect changes in the risk of  reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. The catalytic model assumes the risk of reinfection  is proportional to observed infections. Validation involved using simulated  primary infections, consistent with the number of observed infections in South  Africa. To assess the performance of the catalytic model, we simulated  reinfection datasets that incorporated different processes that may bias  inference, including imperfect observation and mortality. A Bayesian approach  was used to fit the model to simulated data, assuming a negative binomial  distribution around the expected number of reinfections, and model projections  were compared to the simulated data using different magnitudes of change in  reinfection risk. We assessed the model's ability to accurately detect changes  in reinfection risk when included in the simulations, as well as the occurrence  of false positives when reinfection risk remained constant. The model parameters  converged in most scenarios leading to model outputs aligning with anticipated  outcomes. The model successfully detected changes in the risk of reinfection  when such a change was introduced to the data. Low observation probabilities  (10%) of both primary- and reinfections resulted in low numbers of observed  cases from the simulated data and poor convergence. The model's performance was  assessed on simulated data representative of the South African SARS-CoV-2  epidemic, reflecting its timing of waves and outbreak magnitude. Model  performance under similar scenarios may be different in settings with smaller  epidemics (and therefore smaller numbers of reinfections). Ensuring model  parameter convergence is essential to avoid false-positive detection of shifts  in reinfection risk. While the model is robust in most scenarios of imperfect  observation and mortality, further simulation-based validation for regions  experiencing smaller outbreaks is recommended. Caution must be exercised in  directly extrapolating results across different epidemiological contexts without  additional validation efforts.  Copyright: © 2025 Lombard et al.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring reinfections helps predict peaks, variant emergence, and  immunity trends. While reinfection rates between 3 and 31% have been reported, a  better understanding of their variation in different geographical areas could  guide prevention and vaccination efforts. AIMS: This study examines the incidence of COVID-19 reinfection and associated  factors in Mexico over six pandemic waves. Rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2  generates variants that affect reinfection rates and population immunity. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from 3,236,259 primary  infections were analyzed, and 212,892 reinfections were identified. RESULTS: Sex, age, vaccination status, and initial infection severity were found  to be significant predictors of reinfection. Furthermore, the risk of  reinfection decreased with wave progression, especially for those infected  during the first wave. Reduced risk of reinfection after hospitalization  suggests improved exposure prevention. Results indicated increased reinfection  rates during the Omicron wave, particularly for those who were originally  infected during the first wave, with women and middle-aged groups at higher  risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the intricate relationship between viral  evolution, immunity, and demographics, which is crucial for effective pandemic  management and vaccination strategies.

BACKGROUND: Research on long COVID in China is limited, particularly in terms of  large-sample epidemiological data and the effects of recent SARS-CoV-2  sub-variants. China provides an ideal study environment owing to its large  infection base, high vaccine coverage, and stringent pre-pandemic measures. METHODS: This retrospective study used an online questionnaire to investigate  SARS-CoV-2 infection status and long COVID symptoms among 74,075 Chinese  residents over one year. The relationships between baseline characteristics,  vaccination status, pathogenic infection, and long COVID were analyzed using  multinomial logistic regression, and propensity matching. FINDINGS: Analysis of 68,200 valid responses revealed that the most frequent  long COVID symptoms include fatigue (30.53%), memory decline (27.93%), decreased  exercise ability (18.29%), and brain fog (16.87%). These symptoms were less  prevalent among those infected only once: fatigue (24.85%), memory decline  (18.11%), and decreased exercise ability (12.52%), etc. Women were more likely  to experience long COVID, with symptoms varying by age group, except for sleep  disorders and muscle/joint pain, which were more common in older individuals.  Northern China exhibits a higher prevalence of long COVID, potentially linked to  temperature gradients. Risk factors included underlying diseases, alcohol  consumption, smoking, and the severity of acute infection (OR > 1, FDR < 0.05).  Reinfection was associated with milder symptoms but led to a higher incidence  and severity of long COVID (OR > 1, FDR < 0.05). Vaccination, particularly  multiple boosters, significantly reduced long-term symptoms by 30%-70% (OR < 1,  FDR < 0.05). COVID-19 participants also self-reported more bacterial, influenza  and mycoplasma infections, and 8%-10% of patients felt SARS-CoV-2-induced  chronic diseases. INTERPRETATION: This survey provides valuable insights into long COVID situation  among Chinese residents, with 10%-30% (including repeated infection) reporting  symptoms. Monitoring at-risk individuals based on identified risk factors is  essential for public health efforts.

Immunity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  can be induced through either infection with the virus or vaccination, providing  protection against reinfection or reducing the risk of severe clinical outcomes.  In this study, we recruited 172 volunteers who received different vaccination  regimens, including 124 individuals who had recovered from breakthrough  infections caused by the Omicron variant (27 with 2 doses, 49 with 3 doses, and  48 with 4 doses) and 48 healthy donors who did not experience breakthrough  infections (all of whom received a fourth dose during the infection wave). We  measured neutralizing antibody levels against Omicron BA.5.2.48, XBB.1.5, and  JN.1 and found no significant differences in neutralizing antibody titers  between natural infection and homologous booster vaccination at 6 months  (p > 0.05), with geometric mean titers declining by over 100-fold for some  variants relative to the prototype strain.  © 2025 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: After surviving Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), some people  develop symptoms known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC is an  emerging phenomenon yet to be fully understood, and identifying risk factors has  been challenging. This study investigated the association between the number of  COVID-19 episodes and the incidence of PASC among essential workers. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2511 essential workers, mainly first responders,  with confirmed polymerase chain reaction, antibody, or antigen-positive test  results for SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020 to February 2024. Data were  collected through in-person questionnaires and surveys sent via text and email,  internal medical records, follow-up calls, and external medical records.  Participants who reported continuation or the development of new symptoms three  months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms lasting for at  least two months, were categorized as having PASC, while those without any  COVID-19 or whose symptoms resolved were classified as non-PASC. PASC was common  in this cohort so we used a Poisson regression model to compute  multivariable-adjusted Relative Risk (RR) for the association between risk of  PASC and SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, severity, and vaccination status at first  infection. FINDINGS: A total of 475 (prevalence = 18.9%, [95% confidence  interval] = [17.4-20.5]) PASC patients were identified. The mean (standard  deviation (SD)) age of participants who experienced PASC (54.8 (7.2) years) was  similar to those who did not (54.2 (7.4) years). There were 403 (16.1%  [14.6-17.5]) participants who experienced multiple instances of COVID-19. After  adjusting for relevant demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables, we found  a significant association between the risk of experiencing PASC and multiple  SARS-COV-2 infections (RR = 1.41 [1.14-1.74]), severe COVID-19 (RR = 3.17  [2.41-4.16]), and being unvaccinated at first infection (RR = 3.29 [2.46-4.41]). INTERPRETATION: Although the pathogenetic mechanism for PASC remains unclear,  identifying risk factors such as lack of vaccination or re-infection can assist  in better understanding and managing the condition.

(#)Contributed equally  INTRODUCTION: Predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related  rehospitalization remain underexplored. This study aims to identify the main  risk factors associated with rehospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfections among residents of Lombardy,  northern Italy. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using two linked  administrative databases covering demographic data, comorbidities, hospital  records, and COVID-19 data of Lombardy residents. The study population included  patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 2020 and August 2021.  Rehospitalization was defined as a second COVID-19-related hospitalization  occurring at least 90 days after the first admission. The Fine-Gray  subdistribution hazard model was used to identify risk factors, accounting for  death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Out of 98,369 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 1,  2020 and August 31, 2021, 72,593 were alive 90 days after admission and 610 of  these (0.8%) were rehospitalized. A higher rehospitalization risk was observed  in older male patients with multiple comorbidities. Renal failure, liver  disease, and use of diuretics were significantly associated with  rehospitalization risk, while female biological sex and the use of  lipid-lowering drugs were associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study conducted on regional administrative  databases to investigate COVID-19 rehospitalizations. Through the availability  of a huge cohort, it provides a groundwork for optimizing care for individuals  at higher risk for COVID-19-related rehospitalizations. It underlines the need  for patient-management approaches that extend beyond the initial recovery. This  stresses the importance of ongoing monitoring and personalized interventions for  those at heightened risk not only of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection but also related  rehospitalizations.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect modification of health literacy (HL) in  ameliorating the negative impact of underlying health conditions (UHC) on long  COVID among non-hospitalized and hospitalized survivors. STUDY DESIGN: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in Vietnam from  December 2021 to October 2022. METHODS: A sample of 4507 participants recruited from 18 hospitals and health  centers were those aged 18 or older, had contracted COVID-19 for at least 28  days, and were not in the acute phase of reinfection. Participants reported  their long COVID symptoms, UHC, health literacy, socio-demographics, clinical  parameters, the COVID-19 impact battery disability scale, and health-related  behaviors. The logistic regression models were used to examine the associations  and interactions. RESULTS: Underlying health conditions were associated with a higher likelihood  of long COVID in non-hospitalized participants (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.10  [1.61, 2.61]; p < 0.001), and hospitalized ones (aOR = 2.26 [1.87, 2.73];  p < 0.001). In non-hospitalized participants, higher HL scores were  significantly linked to a reduced likelihood of experiencing long COVID  (aOR = 0.96 [0.95, 0.97]; p < 0.001). Furthermore, HL moderated the adverse  effect of underlying health conditions (UHC) on long COVID in this group  (aOR = 0.97 [0.94-0.99]; p = 0.042). In hospitalized participants, although  higher HL scores were also associated with a lower risk of long COVID  (aOR = 0.99 [0.98-0.99]; p = 0.036), HL did not significantly mitigate the  negative impact of UHC on long COVID (aOR = 1.01 [0.99-1.03]; p = 0.332). CONCLUSIONS: In non-hospitalized individuals, high health literacy ameliorated  the negative impact of UHC on long COVID. Such effects of health literacy were  not observed in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring trends in multiple infections with SARS-CoV-2, following  several pandemic waves, provides insight into the biological characteristics of  new variants, but also necessitates methods to understand the risk of multiple  reinfections. OBJECTIVES: We generalised a catalytic model designed to detect increases in the  risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, to assess the population-level risk of multiple  reinfections. METHODS: The catalytic model assumes the risk of reinfection is proportional to  observed infections and uses a Bayesian approach to fit model parameters to the  number of nth infections among individuals that occur at least 90 days after a  previous infection. Using a posterior draw from the fitted model parameters, a  95% projection interval of daily nth infections is calculated under the  assumption of a constant nth infection hazard coefficient. An additional model  parameter was incorporated for the increased reinfection risk detected during  the Omicron wave. The generalised model's performance was then assessed using  simulation-based validation. KEY FINDINGS: No additional increase in the risk of third infection was detected  after the increase detected during the Omicron wave. Using simulation-based  validation, we show that the model can successfully detect increases in the risk  of third infections under different scenarios. LIMITATIONS: Even though the generalised model is intended to detect the risk of  nth infections, it is validated specifically for third infections, with its  applicability for four or more infections being unconfirmed. Furthermore, the  method's sensitivity to low counts of nth infections, limits application in  settings with small epidemics, limited testing coverage or early in an outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The catalytic model was successfully adapted to detect increases in  the risk of nth infections, enhancing our capacity to identify future changes in  the risk of nth infections by SARS-CoV-2 or other similar pathogens.

The extent to which semi-quantitative antibody levels confer protection against  SARS-CoV-2 infection in populations with heterogenous immune histories is  unclear. Two nested case-control studies were designed within the multisite  HEROES/RECOVER prospective cohort of frontline workers to study the relationship  between antibody levels and protection against first-time post-vaccination  infection and reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 from December 2021 to January 2023.  All participants submitted weekly nasal swabs for rRT-PCR testing and blood  samples quarterly and following infection or vaccination. Cases of first-time  post-vaccination infection following a third dose of monovalent (origin strain  WA-1) mRNA vaccine (n = 613) and reinfection (n = 350) were 1:1 matched to  controls based on timing of blood draw and other potential confounders.  Conditional logistic regression models were fit to estimate infection risk  reductions associated with 3-fold increases in end titers for receptor binding  domain (RBD). In first-time post-vaccination and reinfection study samples, most  were female (67%, 57%), non-Hispanic (82%, 68%), and without chronic conditions  (65%, 65%). The odds of first-time post-vaccination infection were reduced by  21% (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = [0.66-0.96]) for each 3-fold increase in RBD end  titers. The odds of reinfection associated with a 3-fold increase in RBD end  titers were reduced by 23% (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.65-0.92] for unvaccinated  individuals and 58% (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI = [0.22-0.84]) for individuals with  three mRNA vaccine doses following their first infection. Frontline workers with  higher antibody levels following a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were at  reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron predominance. Among those with  previous infections, the point estimates of risk reduction associated with  antibody levels was greater for those with three vaccine doses compared to those  who were unvaccinated.

BACKGROUND: Disease severity and pregnancy outcomes following SARS-CoV-2  reinfections in pregnancy are not well understood. METHODS: We linked women aged 18 to 50 years testing positive in the community  for COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022 to hospital, vaccine and maternal  services databases. We compared hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission  rates following infection and reinfection in pregnant and non-pregnant women,  and low birthweight, prematurity and stillbirth in women infected and reinfected  during pregnancy. RESULTS: We identified 68,842 pregnant and 3,915,069 infected non-pregnant  women. Hospital admission after SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was more common in  pregnancy, especially during the third trimester (aOR= 18.56; 95% CI: 9.46 -  36.42) and was similar following reinfection or primary infection in pregnancy  (aOR= 0.82; 95% CI: 0.50 - 1.33). All ICU admissions (n=49) in pregnancy  occurred after primary infection with delta. There was no notable difference in  adverse pregnancy outcomes after primary infection or reinfection with  SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women remain at higher risk of more severe disease during  reinfection compared to non-pregnant women yet; hospitalisation and ICU  admissions risk were low during the omicron period. The virulence of circulating  variants needs to be assessed to guide maternal COVID-19 vaccination programmes  against.  Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

INTRODUCTION: The use of antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2, as a method of  estimating subsequent infection following infection or vaccination, is unclear.  Here, we investigate whether specific levels of antibodies, as markers of  adaptive immunity, can serve to estimate the risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2  (re-) infection. METHODS: In this real-world study, laboratory data from individuals tested for  SARS-CoV-2 antibodies under routine clinical conditions were linked through  tokenization to a United States medical insurance claims database to determine  the risk of symptomatic/severe SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Antibody titer  levels were determined using the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Study  outcomes included the first symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (per ICD-10  diagnostic codes, occurring ≥ 7 days post-antibody titer test), and severe  SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by adverse outcomes including  hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubation, mechanical  ventilation, or death within 30 days of infection. All outcomes were assessed  for 12 months following antibody measurement. Hazard ratios of subsequent  symptomatic and severe infections were estimated using Cox regression with  inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Of 268,844 individuals with antibody data (April 2021-June 2022), those  with levels ≥ 0.8 to < 1,000 U/mL had a 42% reduced risk of symptomatic  infection within 12 months, compared with < 0.8 U/mL (HR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.55,  0.61]). The risk decreased by 53% (HR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.45, 0.49]) with ≥ 1000  to < 2500 U/mL and by 62% (HR = 0.38 [0.36, 0.39]) for ≥ 2500 U/mL. Risk of  severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes was also reduced. Subgroup analyses showed a  consistent association between antibody levels and infection risk, by immune  status and age. Clinically meaningful thresholds of antibody titers varied  between Delta and Omicron infections. CONCLUSION: Higher antibody titer levels indicated reduced risk of developing  symptomatic or severe COVID-19. Titers of ≥ 2500 U/mL indicated a 62-87% reduced  infection risk. The quantitative determination of antibody titers allowed  scaling of the correlate of risk to new variants.  © 2024. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: While the general immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well-understood, the long-term effects of  Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1/Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2  (HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2) co-infection on the immune system remain unclear. This study  investigates the immune response in people with HIV-1 (PWH) co-infected with  SARS-CoV-2 to understand its long-term health consequences. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study of PWH with suppressed viral load  and SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted. Cryopreserved peripheral blood  mononuclear cells and plasma samples were collected at three time-points:  HIV-1/pre-SARS-CoV-2 (n = 18), HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2 (n = 46), and  HIV-1/post-SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36). Plasma levels of 25 soluble cytokines and  chemokines, and anti-S/anti-N-IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured.  Immunophenotyping of innate and adaptive immune components and HIV-1 and  SARS-CoV-2-specific T/B-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection was associated with long-lasting immune  dysfunction, characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and  a decrease in the MIG-IP10-ITAC chemokine axis at the HIV/SARS-CoV-2 time-point,  which persisted one year later. Additionally, alterations in the distribution of  subsets and increased activation (NKG2D/NKG2C) and maturation (TIM3) markers of  NK and dendritic cells were observed at the HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2 time-point,  persisting throughout the study. Effector memory CD4 T-cell subsets were  decreased, while exhaustion/senescence (PD1/TIM3/CD57) markers were elevated at  all three time-points. SARS-CoV-2-specific T/B-cell responses remained stable  throughout the study, while HIV-1-specific T-cell responses decreased at the  HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2 time-point and remained so. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent immune dysfunction in HIV-1/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection  increases the risk of future complications, even in PWH with mild symptoms.  Exacerbated inflammation and alterations in immune cells may contribute to  reduce vaccine efficacy and potential reinfections.  © 2024. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfection, particularly  short-term reinfection, poses challenges to the management of rheumatic diseases  and may increase adverse clinical outcomes. This study aims to develop machine  learning models to predict and identify the risk of short-term COVID-19  reinfection in patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: We developed four prediction models using explainable machine learning  to assess the risk of short-term COVID-19 reinfection in 543 patients with  rheumatic diseases. Psychological health was evaluated using the Functional  Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale, the Patient  Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)  questionnaire, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale. Health  status and disease activity were assessed using the EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level  (EQ-5D-3L) descriptive system and the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) scale. The  model performance was assessed by Area Under the Receiver Operating  Characteristic Curve (AUC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and  the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity (G-mean). SHapley Additive  exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret the contribution of each  predictor to the model outcomes. RESULTS: The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated superior  performance with an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95). Significant factors of  short-term reinfection included glucocorticoid taper (OR = 2.61, 95% CI  1.38-4.92), conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs  (csDMARDs) taper (OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.90-4.64), the number of symptoms  (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.42), and GAD-7 scores (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13).  FACIT-F scores were associated with a lower likelihood of short-term reinfection  (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.96). Besides, we found that the GAD-7 score was one of  the most important predictors. CONCLUSION: We developed explainable machine learning models to predict the risk  of short-term COVID-19 reinfection in patients with rheumatic diseases. SHAP  analysis highlighted the importance of clinical and psychological factors.  Factors included anxiety, fatigue, depression, poor sleep quality, high disease  activity during initial infection, and the use of glucocorticoid taper were  significant predictors. These findings underscore the need for targeted  preventive measures in this patient population.  © 2024. The Author(s).

Considering the end of global emergency status of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) and  the persistent risk of reinfection for healthcare workers (HCWs), it is  important to evaluate the attitude of the HCWs toward reinfecting with COVID-19.  To gather information about participants' concerns regarding reinfection with  COVID-19, a comprehensive online questionnaire was administered to all  individuals involved in the study. DASS-21 was used to assess their mental  health. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with  fear of reinfection. A total of 982 questionnaires were collected for this  study, with only 503 questionnaires included in the final analysis. Of the 503  respondents, 201 (39.96%) feared reinfection with COVID-19. Three factors  emerged as significantly associated with the fear of reinfection: (a) having  been infected with COVID-19 before, (b) feeling that COVID-19 had a lasting  effect on one's life, and (c) experiencing anxiety. The most common factors  reported by those who feared reinfection were: concern about the negative  effects of reinfection on their physical health, worry about the possible  long-term complications of reinfection, and belief that reinfection would not  have a big impact. And the mental state of HCWs has improved and become more  optimistic. Although the morale of HCWs has improved, it remains evident that a  significant portion of them still have concerns about reinfection and continue  to experience anxiety. Moving forward, it is crucial to provide timely  psychological care and support to HCWs, alongside reinforcing efforts in  epidemic management.

Fanella S(1), Bitnun A(1), Barton M(1), Sauvé L(1).  Author information: (1)Canadian Paediatric Society, Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee,  Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  Congenital syphilis can result in pregnancy loss and substantial morbidity in  newborns. The current epidemic of congenital syphilis in Canada (especially  Western Canada) is a preventable public health emergency. Rates indicate a lack  of control of syphilis within the community and insufficient public health  resources to prevent spread that predate the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk factors  include lack of prenatal care, methamphetamine and other substance use, and  unstable housing. The cornerstone of prevention is identification, treatment,  and follow-up during pregnancy, including of partners. Clinicians caring for  newborns need to consider aspects of maternal treatment, reinfection risk, the  results of paired maternal and infant syphilis serology, and infant clinical  assessment. A complete risk assessment will guide effective management and  follow-up of infants exposed in utero to syphilis.  © Canadian Paediatric Society 2024.

BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of developing  persisting/prolonged COVID-19. Data on the early combined use of antivirals and  monoclonal antibodies in this population are scarce. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective study,  enrolling immunocompromised outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, treated  with a combination of sotrovimab plus one antiviral (remdesivir or  nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) within 7 days from symptom onset. Primary outcome was  hospitalization within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were: needing for oxygen  therapy; development of persistent infection; death within 60 days and  reinfection or relapse within 90 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 52 patients. No patient was hospitalized within 30 days of  disease onset, required oxygen administration, died within 60 days, or  experienced a reinfection or clinical relapse within 90 days.The clearance rates  were 67% and 97% on the 14th day after the end of therapy and at the end of the  follow-up period, respectively.Factors associated with longer infection were  initiation of therapy 3 days after symptom onset and enrollment for more than  180 days from the beginning of the study. However, only the latter factor was  independently associated with a longer SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting a loss  of efficacy of this strategy with the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of combination therapy with a direct antiviral  and sotrovimab seems to be effective in preventing hospitalization, progression  to severe COVID-19, and development of prolonged/persisting SARS-CoV-2 infection  in immunocompromised patients.

PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAB) therapy has effectively treated  severe COVID-19, although how this contributes to protective antiviral immunity  in settings of malignancy is poorly defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the development of post-infection immunity in  five patients with malignancies who received mAB therapy targeting spike protein  for their PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2021, compared with non-mAB  controls. Patients were identified from a larger study on oncology with a  history or documented current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects include two  patients with lymphoma and CD20-depletion therapy, one with myeloma and two with  solid tumor (stage IIA rectal adenocarcinoma and metastatic breast cancer).  Cancer therapies and COVID vaccination history varied by patient. Blood samples  (1-4 per patient) were collected 71-635 days post-mAB therapy. We employed  clinical histories with comprehensive immunoprofiling analysis, including  systems serology antibody isotyping and effector function, T-cell  immunophenotyping for subset and memory cells, and sensitive blood viral RNA  detection up to 2 years post-mAB therapy. RESULTS: B-cell deficiency was confirmed in 3/5 patients. All patients had  detectable anti-spike and nucleoprotein antibody isotypes, effector functions,  and neutralizing antibodies (which increased over time by subject) at similar  levels to the control group. Virus-specific T-cell activation and phenotypes  varied by time and patient. Spike-specific effector and memory CD8 + T-cells  were significantly elevated in mAB subjects compared to the control group.  SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection was also higher in mAB-treated patients. One  patient on bortezomib therapy had unique alterations in these populations. CONCLUSION: All mAB-treated patients with malignancies developed polyfunctional  immunity humoral and T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 even in the setting of B-cell  deficiency. The evolution of this immunity, including new variant-specific  antibodies, without secondary illnesses suggests that patients were protected  from symptomatic re-infection, and mAB therapy did not blunt the development of  host immunity. Future studies are warranted to better characterize immunologic  memory over time with exposures to new viral variants, evaluate prolonged viral  shedding and the continued use of appropriate mAB for infection in high-risk  patients.  © 2024 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: After the lifting of epidemic control measures in China at the end  of 2022, the number of COVID-19 infections has increased dramatically. Such an  upsurge may intensify people's health anxiety and raise concerns about the risk  of reinfection. While numerous studies have shown the correlation between them  during the COVID-19, research on their underlying mechanism remains limited. PURPOSE: This study aims to test the relationship and mechanism between health  anxiety and perceived risk of reinfection among COVID-19 infected people from  different occupational backgrounds. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 24th to 28th, 2022,  after the epidemic control measures were lifted. A total of 1122 Chinese  individuals were infected with COVID-19 (67.91% females, M age = 28.13)  completed measures of health anxiety, perceived risk of reinfection, fear of  COVID-19, online health information seeking (OHIS), and COVID-19 information  fear of missing out (FOMO). Data were analyzed using multiple-mediation model  and multi-group analysis. RESULTS: Health anxiety, perceived risk of reinfection, fear of COVID-19, OHIS  and COVID-19 information FOMO were positively and significantly related to each  other (r ranged from 0.25 to 0.77, all p < 0.001). Fear of COVID-19 (β = 0.27, p  < 0.01), OHIS (β = 0.10, p < 0.001), and COVID-19 information FOMO (β = -0.05, p  < 0.01) fully mediated the relationship between health anxiety and perceived  risk of reinfection, the path of chaining mediation is also significant.  Discrepancies in mediation models surfaced across the three types of work  groups. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest fear of COVID-19, OHIS and COVID-19 information  FOMO may play significant mediating roles in explaining the relationship between  health anxiety and perceived risk of reinfection. Interventions to reduce the  perceived risk of reinfection should aim to improve the quality of online health  information and individuals' online health literacy and reduce fear of COVID-19  during and after the pandemic.  © 2024 Zhao et al.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: As the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 progresses, it becomes  crucial to comprehend the lasting effects of vaccination on safeguarding against  new infections or reinfections. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the risk of new SARS-CoV-2 infections  based on the number of vaccine doses, prior infections, and other clinical  characteristics. METHODS: We defined a cohort of 800 health care workers in a 24-month study  (March 2020 to December 2022) in northern Barcelona to determine new infections  by SARS-CoV-2. We used extended Cox models, specifically Andersen-Gill (AG) and  Prentice-Williams-Peterson, and we examined the risk of new infections. The AG  model incorporated variables such as sex, age, job title, number of chronic  conditions, vaccine doses, and prior infections. Additionally, 2  Prentice-Williams-Peterson models were adjusted, one for those individuals with  no or 1 infection and another for those with 2 or 3 infections, both with the  same covariates as the AG model. RESULTS: The 800 participants (n=605, 75.6% women) received 1, 2, 3, and 4 doses  of the vaccine. Compared to those who were unvaccinated, the number of vaccine  doses significantly reduced (P<.001) the risk of infection by 66%, 81%, 89%, and  99%, respectively. Unit increase in the number of prior infections reduced the  risk of infection by 75% (P<.001). When separating individuals by number of  previous infections, risk was significantly reduced for those with no or 1  infection by 61% (P=.02), and by 88%, 93%, and 99% (P<.001) with 1, 2, 3, or 4  doses, respectively. In contrast, for those with 2 or 3 previous infections, the  reduction was only significant with the fourth dose, at 98% (P<.001). The number  of chronic diseases only increased the risk by 28%-31% (P<.001) for individuals  with 0-1 previous infections. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that both prior infections and vaccination  status significantly contribute to SARS-CoV-2 immunity, supporting vaccine  effectiveness in reducing risk of reinfection for up to 24 months after  follow-up from the onset of the pandemic. These insights contribute to our  understanding of long-term immunity dynamics and inform strategies for  mitigating the impact of COVID-19.  © Pere Torán-Monserrat, Noemí Lamonja-Vicente, Anna Costa-Garrido, Lucía A  Carrasco-Ribelles, Bibiana Quirant, Marc Boigues, Xaviera Molina, Carla Chacón,  Rosalia Dacosta-Aguayo, Fernando Arméstar, Eva María Martínez Cáceres, Julia G  Prado, Concepción Violán, ProHEpiC-19 study group.

With approximately  0.1 %-6.8 % experiencing reinfection. This retrospective cohort study aimed to  compare the risk of short-term circulatory and respiratory sequelae between  SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and initial infection, and assess the impact of  vaccination. METHOD: Data from the TriNetX US Collaborative network (2020-2022) were used to  create two cohorts based on reinfection status. The main outcome assessed were  medical utilization, circulatory and respiratory symptoms, and circulatory and  respiratory diseases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the risks  between two cohorts. Four subgroup analyses (vaccination status, age, sex, race)  and six sensitivity analyses (rigorous definition, modified exclusion criteria,  treatment, different COVID-19 variants timeline, address survivorship bias, and  E-value calculation) were also conducted. RESULTS: The reinfection cohort showed a significant reduction in medical  utilization [ Hazard ratio, HR: 0.867, (95 % confidence interval,  CI:0.839-0.896) for hospitalization, 0.488 (0.418-0.570) for critical care  services, and 0.476 (0.360-0.629) for mechanical ventilation], lower risk of  circulatory diseases [ HR: 0.701 (95 % CI:0.637-0.772), 0.695 (0.583-0.829),  0.660 (0.605-0.719), 0.741 (0.644-0.854), 0.614 (0.535-0.705), and 0.758  (0.656-0.876) for ischemic heart disease, inflammatory heart disease,  dysrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, other cardiac disorders, and  cerebrovascular diseases, respectively], and lower risk of respiratory diseases  such as pneumonia, other acute lower respiratory infections, asthma, and  hypoxemia [HR: 0.302 (95 % CI: 0.273-0.333), 0.811 (0.686-0.958), 0.791  (0.735-0.850), and 0.392 (0.338-0.455), respectively]. The vaccinated  reinfection cohort showed no significant differences in medical utilization,  circulatory diseases, or respiratory conditions but had a higher risk of  breathing abnormalities. breathing abnormalities [HR: 1.195 (95 %  CI:1.087-1.313)]. CONCLUSIONS: The individuals who experienced reinfection exhibited milder  short-term sequelae in the circulatory and respiratory systems. Vaccine  administration protects against cardiovascular or respiratory systems.  Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: The enduring psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue  to affect individuals long after the immediate health concerns have subsided.  This research aims to identify specific groups within the Romanian population  who are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health challenges that can  interfere with everyday life and may lead to more serious mental health  disorders. METHODS: Conducted as a cross-sectional survey, this study assessed the severity  of psychological distress using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21  (DASS-21) questionnaire in relation to COVID-19-related information and  socio-demographic data to investigate the factors associated with psychological  distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania. RESULTS: Analysis of 521 questionnaires, filled out by a predominantly  middle-aged cohort of 320 women and 201 men (mean age = 42.24, SD = 11.96),  revealed that 63.72% of participants worked outside the healthcare field. Those  unemployed or retired reported significantly higher anxiety levels than  individuals in other sectors. Moreover, living alone, experiencing the loss of  close relatives (6.14%) or friends (33.59%), and undergoing hospitalization or  reinfection due to COVID-19 were linked to significantly elevated distress  scores. CONCLUSION: By identifying the segments of the population most vulnerable to  psychological distress, as evidenced by higher scores among the unemployed,  retirees, individuals living alone, and those directly affected by COVID-19  through personal health or loss, targeted initiatives for psychological  screening and therapy can be established. Such measures are essential for  enhancing the post-pandemic mental well-being of Romanians, addressing the  specific needs uncovered in this study. These findings are limited by the study  type and sample size; therefore, more extensive, longitudinal research conducted  on a larger population sample is necessary.

Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) syndrome represents a cluster of  persistent symptoms following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) infection that can severely affect quality of life. The pathogenic  mechanisms and epidemiology in different regions are still under evaluation. To  assess the outcomes of post-COVID-19 syndrome, we performed a  questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study in previously infected individuals.  Out of 549 respondents, (male:female ratio: 0.32), 29.5% had persistent symptoms  at 3 months, 23.5% had persistent symptoms at 6 months, and 18.3% had persistent  symptoms at 12 months after the initial infection. The most common symptoms  included fatigue (8.7%), sleep disturbances (7.1%), and cognitive impairment  (6.4%). The risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome increased for those with  more symptoms in the acute phase (OR 4.24, p < 0.001) and those experiencing  reinfections (OR 2.405, p < 0.001), while SARS-CoV-2 vaccination halved the risk  (OR = 0.489, p = 0.004). Individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome had a 5.7-fold  higher risk of being diagnosed with a new chronic condition, with 44% reporting  cardiovascular disease, and a 6.8-fold higher likelihood of needing medical care  or leave. Affected individuals reported significant impairments in mobility,  pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, with 20.7% needing to adjust their work  schedules. Overall, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome require ongoing  monitoring and rehabilitation, and further socio-economic impact studies are  needed.

INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2  infection. Viral surveillance for early detection of COVID-19 is a critical  strategy to understand this population's infection dynamics and prevent  transmission. The study examines SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection among HCWs  vaccinated against COVID-19 working at a primary healthcare unit serving a  disenfranchised community in Brazil. METHODS: The study was conducted in Cidade Estrutural, Federal District, Brazil,  between February and October 2021. Participants were interviewed and provided  samples. A prospective open cohort study was used to analyze the frequency of  SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection, and the vaccine-induced seroconversion.  Nasopharyngeal swab specimen was collected from workers presenting with flu-like  symptoms and subjected to RT-qPCR. Peripheral blood samples were also collected  every 30 ± 2 days for eight months, starting from the day participants received  their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and submitted to serological testing (IgM  and IgG chemiluminescence). The frequencies of infection and reinfection  (RT-qPCR positive results 90 days after the infection) were calculated along  with their respective confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of the 128 workers, 61 (47.65%; CI: 39.19-56.25) reported probable  SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination and 50 (39.06%; CI: 31.04-47.71) had  SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, confirmed by molecular test. Reinfection  was identified in seven workers (7/50, 14%; CI: 6.95-26.18) based on the 90-day  interval between results. The serological data from the 128 workers during the  cohort indicated that 68 (53.12%; CI: 44.5-61.5) had IgG antibodies and 46 had  IgM antibodies (35.93%; CI: 28.14-44.54) against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2  infection was common in 56% of the community health workers (CHWs), 50% of  registered nurses, and licensed vocational nurses (33%). Following the COVID-19  vaccination, the percentage of infections among HCWs decreased from 47.83% to  4.35%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that (i) approximately 40% of the workers  were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2021 and (ii) reinfections confirmed by RT-qPCR  occurred in 14% of the HCWs after vaccination. The results provide valuable  insights into the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs in a primary care unit  serving a minoritized community.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with vascular liver diseases (VLD) are at higher  risk of both severe courses of COVID-19 disease and thromboembolic events. The  impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with VLD has not been described and  represents the aim of our study. METHODS: International, multicenter, prospective observational study in patients  with VLD analyzing the incidence of COVID-19 infection after vaccination,  severity of side effects, occurrence of thromboembolic events and hepatic  decompensation. In a subgroup of patients, the humoral and cellular responses to  vaccination were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 898 patients from 14 European centers - part of the VALDIG  network - were included, 872 (97.1%) patients received two vaccine doses (fully  vaccinated), and 674 (75.1%) three doses. Of the total cohort, 151/898 had a  COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination, of whom 9/151 (5.9%) were re-infected.  Of the 747/898 patients who were not previously infected, 11.2% (84/747) were  diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection during the study period. Two infected  patients required intensive care unit admission and infection was fatal in two  fully vaccinated patients. Adverse effects were reported in around 40% of  patients, with local side effects being the most frequent. During the study  period, 31 (3.5%) patients had thromboembolic events and 21 (2.3%) hepatic  decompensations. No cases of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia were reported.  Vaccine immunogenicity was assessed in 36 patients; seroconversion reached 100%  and IFNy T-cell responses significantly increased post two mRNA-1273 vaccine  doses. CONCLUSION: Patients with VLD seem to have a preserved immune response to  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which appears to be safe and effective in preventing  severe COVID-19 infection. Our study cannot definitively establish a direct link  between vaccination and thrombotic events, though the contribution of  vaccination as a cofactor in VLD remains to be elucidated. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Patients with vascular liver disease (VLD) are at  increased risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. The  potential risks associated with vaccination against this infection need thorough  investigation. Our research enhances the understanding of the effects of  COVID-19 vaccination in patients with VLD, highlighting its good tolerability.  Moreover, patients with VLD appear to have a preserved immune response to  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, providing protection against severe COVID-19 infection.  Our study cannot definitively establish a direct link between vaccination and  thrombotic events, and no cases of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia were  reported.  © 2024 The Authors.

(#)Contributed equally  Update of     Res Sq. 2023 Nov 29:rs.3.rs-3637405. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3637405/v1.  Antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants increase the reinfection risk for  vaccinated and previously exposed population due to antibody neutralization  escape. COVID-19 severity depends on many variables, including host immune  responses, which differ depending on genetic predisposition. To address this, we  perform immune profiling of female mice with different genetic backgrounds  -transgenic K18-hACE2 and wild-type 129S1- infected with the severe B.1.351, 30  days after exposure to the milder BA.1 or severe H1N1. Prior BA.1 infection  protects against B.1.351-induced morbidity in K18-hACE2 but aggravates disease  in 129S1. H1N1 protects against B.1.351-induced morbidity only in 129S1.  Enhanced severity in B.1.351 re-infected 129S1 is characterized by an increase  of IL-10, IL-1β, IL-18 and IFN-γ, while in K18-hACE2 the cytokine profile  resembles naïve mice undergoing their first viral infection. Enhanced pathology  during 129S1 reinfection cannot be attributed to weaker adaptive immune  responses to BA.1. Infection with BA.1 causes long-term differential remodeling  and transcriptional changes in the bronchioalveolar CD11c+ compartment.  K18-hACE2 CD11c+ cells show a strong antiviral defense expression profile  whereas 129S1 CD11c+ cells present a more pro-inflammatory response upon  restimulation. In conclusion, BA.1 induces cross-reactive adaptive immune  responses in K18-hACE2 and 129S1, but reinfection outcome correlates with  differential CD11c+ cells responses in the alveolar space.  © 2024.

Electronic address:  petra.zimmermann@unifr.ch.  The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has evolved  throughout the pandemic, with initially low infection rates rising significantly  as a result of the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant.  Adolescents, children from ethnic minorities and lower-income households, and  those with obesity are at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The immune response in children  leads to milder symptoms compared to adults, with fever and cough being most  frequent; tough symptoms vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant and age. Diagnostic methods  to confirm current or past infection include reverse transcription PCR, rapid  antigen tests, and serology. Treatment is mainly supportive, with antivirals and  glucocorticoids reserved for severe cases. While serious conditions like  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and other post-COVID-19 conditions  are rare, they require careful management. Vaccination has proven effective in  reducing severe disease and protecting against post-COVID-19 conditions.  Continued surveillance, including wastewater monitoring and universal or pooled  testing, remains crucial for controlling community spread. Key questions remain  regarding the duration and quality of immunity after reinfection or vaccination,  the impact of coinfections, and optimal treatment protocols for different  pediatric populations.

Compromised CD8+ T cell immunity in the aged brain increases severity of  neurotropic coronavirus infection and postinfectious cognitive impairment.  Reagin KL(1), Lee RL(1), Williams LA(1), Cocciolone L(1), Funk KE(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte,  Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.  Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as  well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that  perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8+ T cell response predisposes elderly  individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious  cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus,  we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This  was coupled with increased CD8+ T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen  specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103+  resident memory cells (TRM), which correlated with increased severity of  secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data  show that not only were fewer aged CD8+ T cells retained within the adult brain  post-infection, but also that adult CD8+ cells expressed lower levels of TRM  marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals  demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened  in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial  learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal  neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture  showed that activated CD8+ T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons,  independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that  non-antigen specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause  broad neuronal death without establishing a TRM phenotype that confers lasting  protection against a secondary infection.  © 2024 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  With the continuous spread of the SARS-CoV-2 globally, viral mutations have  accumulated. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 became more contagious, and has a higher  risk of immune escape and reinfection. To identify variants and have an  awareness of the prevalence of these variants, this study selected four segments  containing mutations on the S gene of the SARS-CoV-2. Then a rapid and  convenient variants detection method was established using high-resolution  melting(HRM) analysis combined with nested polymerase chain reaction(PCR). The  total detection process takes about 5 h. Through comprehensive analysis of the  results from the four reaction systems, the identification of seven important  Omicron variants(BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.5.2, BF.7, BQ.1, XBB.1 and XBB.2) can be  achieved, with significant differentiation in the melting curves of each variant  group. The method established in this study was used to genotype positive  specimens in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, the overall concordance rate  compared to whole genome sequencing results was 88.9%, and the positive  concordance rate of each sublineage was greater than 80% and the negative  concordance rate was greater than 94.4%. The detection of clinical specimens has  demonstrated that the HRM analysis established in this study is an effective,  rapid and convenient variant identification method, which can be used for  monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants and has important value in addressing public  health issues caused by the ongoing mutations of the SARS-CoV-2.  © 2024.

The clinical manifestations of variability in PLWH with SARS-CoV-2 acquired may  be attributed to the use of ART drugs. Omicron breakthrough infection and  reinfection in 27 PLWH treated with BIC/FTC/TAF and 51 PLWH treated with  TDF/3TC/EFV were investigated, and humoral and cellular immunity after Omicron  breakthrough infection were also compared. The results showed that Omicron  breakthrough infection symptoms in BIC/FTC/TAF-treated had a shorter duration,  and BIC/FTC/TAF could further reduce the duration of symptoms when re-infected.  It was also found that the BA.5 specific IgG titers of BIC/FTC/TAF-treated were  significantly increased and increased with the extension of the duration of  BIC/FTC/TAF. In cellular immunity, the use of BIC/FTC/TAF was also found to  increase not only BA.5-specific B lymphocytes and BA.5-specific CD4+T  lymphocytes, but also total CD4+T cells. In conclusion, compared to TDF/3TC/EFV,  BIC/FTC/TAF can help PLWH shorten the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, enhance  SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and cellular immune responses, help to expand the  total CD4+T cells increase in PLWH after Omicron infection and may be more  beneficial for PLWH with high risk of infection in the context of COVID-19  normalization.  © 2024 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global  health concern and has persisted through the emergence of variants that have  caused subsequent waves of COVID-19 due to the high dispersion and  contagiousness of the virus. The aim of this work was to analyze the  epidemiology of the cases of reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants during the third and fourth wave of the  COVID-19 pandemic at the Hospital Juárez de México (HJM). METHODOLOGY: A prospective study of the cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection,  variants detected, symptoms, and associated comorbidities was carried out on  1,347 patients who attended the HJM from September 2021 to July 2022. RESULTS: 760 (56.4%) and 587 (43.6%) patients were negative and positive for  SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The Omicron variant was the most frequent and the most  common symptoms were: cough (80%), headache (61.32%), fever (51.6%), and dyspnea  (40%). A higher proportion of females were vaccinated, ranging from one dose to  the complete schedule. The factors that were associated with a greater risk of  death from complications of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were male gender, diabetes  mellitus, and arterial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Females were the most susceptible to an Omicron reinfection event,  even though they were vaccinated. However, the risk of death was higher when the  patient was male; being male was a potential risk factor for death from COVID-19  and comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess COVID-19 re-infection rates among  individuals previously infected between 2020 and November 2022, particularly  during the first wave of high-intensity transmission, and to identify the risk  factors associated with re-infection in Jiangsu Province, China. METHODOLOGY: Epidemiological investigations were conducted through telephone  interviews and face-to-face visits in February and March 2023. Statistical  analyses included the Chi-square or Fisher`s exact test for categorical data,  Student's t-test for numerical data, Poisson regression for influencing factors,  and Kaplan-Meier for cumulative re-infection risk. RESULTS: Among 12,910 individuals surveyed, 957 (7.4%) cases of re-infection  were identified. Re-infection rates varied significantly by initial infection  period: 42.5% in January-February 2020, 15.5% in July-August 2021, 6.7% in  March-April 2022, and 1.1% in September-October 2022. Females and individuals  aged 18-50 years were more susceptible to re-infection. A reduced risk of  re-infection was observed in those who received four vaccine doses, with a  relative risk of 0.25 (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: For populations prone to COVID-19 re-infections, particularly  females and young adults aged 18-50 years, receiving four or more vaccine doses  effectively reduces the likelihood of repeated infections. These findings  emphasize the need to prioritize vaccination and protect high-risk groups in  COVID-19 prevention efforts.

(#)Contributed equally  Vaccination against the wild-type (WT) severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus did not produce detectable levels of  neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the BA.5 strain before it emerged.  However, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity varied highly between  unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated individuals, for  unknown reasons. We assessed the severity of BA.5 infection and the risk of XBB  strain reinfection and measured serum levels of NAbs against WT, BA.5, and  XBB.1.9.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains at varying time points in 1,373 individuals who  received zero, one, two, or three WT vaccine doses. We found that two to three  WT doses significantly increased WT and BA.5 NAb levels and reduced the  incidence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia upon BA.5 strain infection compared  to zero to one dose. Regarding XBB reinfection, those who received two to three  doses and were infected with the BA.5 variant exhibited a significantly lower  reinfection risk compared to those who received zero to one dose. RNA analysis  revealed that the differentially expressed genes between the two to three dose  and unvaccinated groups were enriched in B cell activation, cytokine-cytokine  receptor interaction, complement, and monocyte activation functions-indicating  that vaccination increased the antibody response and reduced inflammation. Our  results suggest that multiple antigen exposures to either matched or unmatched  SARS-COV-2 variants, through vaccination or infection, may be necessary to  achieve significant immune imprinting.IMPORTANCEThe administration of  coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that do not perfectly match the  viral strains that individuals become infected with has been found to impact the  resultant illness severity-although the precise mechanism underlying this  phenomenon remains unclear. We assessed viral clearance, as well as serum levels  of inflammatory cytokines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wild-type,  BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 among individuals who received varying doses of such  strain-mismatched vaccines. Notably, vaccination with ≥2 doses of  strain-mismatched COVID-19 vaccines appeared to stimulate the production of  specific NAbs during infection with new variants, as well as attenuate the  inflammatory response and enhance viral clearance. Such vaccination regimens can  also reduce the risk of reinfection. These findings may be important for guiding  the development of future COVID-19 vaccination strategies that target both  matched and mismatched viral variants.

INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute respiratory tract  infection (ARTI) and reinfects adults throughout life, posing a risk for  hospitalization in older adults (>60 years) with frailty and comorbidities. METHODS: To investigate serum and mucosal antibodies for protection against RSV  infections, baseline serum samples were compared for RSV-pre- and -post-fusion  (F) binding, and RSV-A2 neutralizing IgG antibodies between symptomatic RSV-ARTI  (N = 30), non-RSV (RSV negative) ARTI (N = 386), and no ARTI (N = 338). Mucosal  RSV-pre-F IgA and IgG levels, as well as serum RSV-G IgG antibodies, were  analyzed to determine their association with protection from symptomatic  RSV-ARTI in a subset study. RESULTS: Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we  established thresholds of 1.4- to 1.6-fold change (FC) for RSV-pre-F and  -post-F, and RSV-A2 neutralizing IgG antibodies, respectively, enabling the  identification of asymptomatic RSV cases with high sensitivity and specificity  (>80% and >90%, respectively). As a result, serum RSV-pre-F, RSV-G IgG, and  mucosal pre-F binding IgA antibodies showed correlations with protection against  symptomatic RSV infection. RSV-pre-F IgG antibodies were correlated with  protection from RSV infections irrespective of the symptoms. DISCUSSION: This study provides insights into antibody-mediated protection for  symptomatic RSV infection in a community-dwelling older-adult population and  establishes a threshold to identify asymptomatic RSV infection using a  data-driven approach.

BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted global  health, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and overwhelming healthcare  systems, particularly in Iran. Understanding reinfection is crucial as it has  significant implications for immunity, public health strategies, and vaccine  development. This study aims to identify rate and the risk factors associated  with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection  and compare the clinical course of initial infection versus reinfection in  readmitted COVID-19 patients in Iran. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2020 to the  end of 2022 in five hospitals in Iran. The study compared demographic and  clinical data, vaccination status, and clinical outcomes between patients with  reinfection (defined as a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at least 90 days  after the primary admission) and a control group (patients who had an initial  confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but were not readmitted with a positive PCR test  for SARS-CoV-2 at least 90 days after their primary infection). Risk factors for  reinfection were evaluated using a regression model. Propensity score matching  (PSM) was used to compare post-clinical and laboratory outcomes between the  matched case and control groups. RESULTS: Out of 31,245 patients, 153 (0.49%) experienced reinfections. The  reinfection rate was significantly higher during B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 variant  wave (p < 0.001). After multivariable regression analysis, incomplete  vaccination status (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.34-2.31, p = 0.021) and lack of booster  vaccination (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.96-3.65, p = 0.001) were the risk factors for  reinfection. Furthermore, reinfection was associated with atypical COVID-19  symptoms, and shorter ICU and hospital stays (p < 0.001). The B.1.1.529 variant  was significantly more common among reinfected patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 reinfections are more frequently observed during waves of  novel variants and are associated with a milder clinical course and shorter  hospital stays. Full vaccination and booster doses can effectively reduce the  risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections.  Copyright © 2024 Shahrbaf, Alimohamadi, Yousefi Arfaei, Salesi, Izadi and Raei.

INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis, popularly known as the black fungus, has become a  worldwide concern in the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, causing increased  morbidity and death in immunocompromised people. Due to multi-drug resistance  and the limited number of antifungals, surgical interventions, ‎including the  excision of infected tissue, remain a standard treatment option‎. Surgical  treatment usually results in the loss of organs or their function, long-term  intensive care, and a significant risk of reinfection during the procedure. A  comprehensive approach is needed to treat the disease, and nanomaterials can be  a powerful alternative therapeutic approach. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar with the keywords  'emerging role of nanomaterials,' and 'combating COVID-19-related mucormycosis,'  and reviewed the related research paper. Antifungal nanomaterials and their  delivery can significantly impact the treatment of COVID-19-related fungal  infections like mucormycosis. However, the therapeutic options for mucormycosis  are limited and drug resistance is also reported. EXPERT OPINION: The current review encompasses a detailed overview of the recent  developments in antifungal/antiviral nanomaterials and the properties of these  therapeutic nanomaterials that may contribute to formulating an efficient  strategy against invasive mucormycosis. Further extensive research is needed to  develop nano-based therapeutics for the management of mucormycosis-viral  coinfection with a definitive end-point.

This study analyzes immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection,  including asymptomatic cases, focusing on infection risks during the Omicron  wave, particularly among high-risk healthcare workers. In the KoCo-Impf study,  we monitored 6088 vaccinated participants in Munich aged 18 and above. From 13  May to 31 July 2022, 2351 participants were follow-uped. Logistic regression  models evaluated primary, secondary, and breakthrough infections (BTIs). Roche  Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays detected prior infections (via anti-Nucleocapsid  antibodies) and assessed vaccination/infection impact (via anti-Spike  antibodies) using dried blood spots. Our findings revealed an anti-Nucleocapsid  seroprevalence of 44.1%. BTIs occurred in 38.8% of participants, with  reinfections in 48.0%. Follow-up participation was inversely associated with  current smoking and non-vaccination, while significantly increasing with age and  receipt of three vaccine doses. Larger household sizes and younger age increased  infection risks, whereas multiple vaccinations and older age reduced them.  Household size and specific institutional subgroups were risk factors for BTIs.  The anti-Nucleocapsid value prior to the second infection was significantly  associated with reinfection risk. Institutional subgroups influenced all models,  underscoring the importance of tailored outbreak responses. The KoCo-Impf study  underscores the importance of vaccination, demographic factors, and  institutional settings in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection risks during the  Omicron wave.

Backgound/Objectives: Cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 real-time  reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are associated  with infectivity and viral load, and they could be an aid in forecasting the  evolution of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The objective was to know the Ct values  related to the incidence and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in successive outbreaks,  which took place in nursing homes in Castellon (Spain) during 2020-2022, and to  test its usefulness as an instrument of epidemic surveillance in nursing homes. METHODS: a retrospective cohort design with Poisson regression and multinomial  logistic regression were used. RESULTS: We studied four nursing home SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and the average  infection rate, reinfection rate, and case fatality were 72.7%, 19.9%, and 5.5%,  respectively; 98.9% of residents were vaccinated with three doses of a mRNA  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Ct values for first infections and reinfections were 27.1 ±  6.6 and 31.9 ± 5.4 (p = 0.000). Considering Ct values ≥ 30 versus <30, residents  with reinfections had Ct values higher than residents with a first infection, an  adjusted relative risk of 1.66 (95% Confidence interval 1.10-2.51). A  sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (hybrid immunity) could  protect against severe disease better than vaccination alone. High Ct values  suggest lower transmission and severity. Its value can be useful for  surveillance and forecasting future SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

PURPOSE: To identify the prevalence and risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) reinfection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed patients with RA with  a documented COVID-19 infection between January 2021 and December 2022 at a  tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Reinfection was defined as a subsequent  positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at  least 3 months after the initial infection. Cox proportional hazards models with  backward elimination were employed to assess the association between potential  risk factors and risk of reinfection. RESULTS: Of 351 included patients with RA {female, 81.5%; median age, 58.0 years  [interquartile range (IQR), 48.0-66.0]}, 252 (71.8%) were treated with  methotrexate and 12 (3.4%) received leflunomide during the initial infection.  Over a median follow-up of 1.5 (IQR, 1.1-1.6) years, 43 (12.3%) patients  experienced reinfection, equating to an incidence rate of 8.97 per 100  patient-years. The median time interval between infections was 0.8 (IQR,  0.6-1.2) years. Among the risk factors, leflunomide use showed a significant  association with reinfection (hazard ratio, 2.968; 95% confidence interval,  1.057-8.335; p=0.039). However, no significant changes occurred in disease  activity following reinfection [disease activity score using 28 joints: baseline  median, 2.3 (IQR, 1.9-2.8); post-reinfection median, 2.3 (IQR, 1.8-2.6), p for  change=0.895]. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study of patients with RA with COVID-19  infection, approximately 12% of patients experienced reinfection without  significant change in disease activity. Leflunomide use was associated with a  higher risk of reinfection.  © Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2024.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations in previously  SARS-CoV-2-infected adults in the general population of Austria during the Delta  wave and with extended follow-up. METHODS: In a nationwide retrospective cohort study, we calculated age-, sex-,  and nursing home residency-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) of  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths, SARS-CoV-2 infections, and  non-COVID-19 deaths from 1 October to 31 December 2021, and secondarily with  extended follow-up to 30 June 2022. Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) is rVE  = (1 - HR) × 100. RESULTS: Among 494 646 previously infected adults, 169 543 had received 2  vaccine doses, 133 567 had received 1 dose, and 190 275 were unvaccinated at  baseline. We recorded 17 COVID-19 deaths (6 vaccinated, 11 unvaccinated) and  8209 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Absolute risk of COVID-19 deaths was 0.003%. rVE  estimates for COVID-19 deaths and reinfections exceeded 75% until the end of  2021 but decreased substantially with extended follow-up. The risk of  non-COVID-19 death was lower in those vaccinated versus unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: First and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses appear effective in the  short-term, but with diminishing effectiveness over time. The extremely low  COVID-19 mortality, regardless of vaccination, indicates strong protection of  previous infection against COVID-19 death. Lower non-COVID-19 mortality in the  vaccinated population might suggest a healthy vaccinee bias.  © The Author(s) 2024.

OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of COVID-19 has substantially changed since its  emergence given the availability of effective vaccines, circulation of different  viral variants, and re-infections. We aimed to develop models to predict 30-day  COVID-19 hospitalization and death in the Omicron era for contemporary clinical  and research applications. METHODS: We used comprehensive electronic health records from a national cohort  of patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) who tested positive for  SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. Full models incorporated  84 predictors, including demographics, comorbidities, and receipt of COVID-19  vaccinations and anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments. Parsimonious models included 19  predictors. We created models for 30-day hospitalization or death, 30-day  hospitalization, and 30-day all-cause mortality. We used the Super Learner  ensemble machine learning algorithm to fit prediction models. Model performance  was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  (AUC), Brier scores, and calibration intercepts and slopes in a 20% holdout  dataset. RESULTS: Models were trained and tested on 198,174 patients, of whom 8% were  hospitalized or died within 30 days of testing positive. AUCs for the full  models ranged from 0.80 (hospitalization) to 0.91 (death). Brier scores were  close to 0, with the lowest error in the mortality model (Brier score: 0.01).  All three models were well calibrated with calibration intercepts <0.23 and  slopes <1.05. Parsimonious models performed comparably to full models. CONCLUSIONS: We developed prediction models that accurately estimate COVID-19  hospitalization and mortality risk following emergence of the Omicron variant  and in the setting of COVID-19 vaccinations and antiviral treatments. These  models may be used for risk stratification to inform COVID-19 treatment and to  identify high-risk patients for inclusion in clinical trials.

(1) Background: early in the COVID-19 pandemic, reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was limited. Assessing seroprevalence helps  understand prevalence and reinfection risk. However, such data are lacking for  the first epidemic wave in Belgian nursing homes. Therefore, we assessed  SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and cumulative RT-PCR positivity in Belgian nursing  homes and evaluated reinfection risk. (2) Methods: we performed a  cross-sectional study in nine nursing homes in April and May 2020. Odds ratios  (ORs) were calculated to compare the odds of (re)infection between seropositive  and seronegative participants. (3) Results: seroprevalence was 21% (95% CI:  18-23): 22% (95% CI: 18-25) in residents and 20% (95% CI: 17-24) in staff. By 20  May 2020, cumulative RT-PCR positivity was 16% (95% CI: 13-21) in residents and  8% (95% CI: 6-12) in staff. ORs for (re)infection in seropositive (compared to  seronegative) residents and staff were 0.22 (95% CI: 0.06-0.72) and 3.15 (95%  CI: 1.56-6.63), respectively. (4) Conclusion: during the first wave, RT-PCR test  programmes underestimated the number of COVID-19 cases. The reinfection rate in  residents was 3%, indicating protection, while it was 21% in staff, potentially  due to less cautious health behaviour. Future outbreaks should use both RT-PCR  and serological testing for complementary insights into transmission dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Children can develop Long Covid, however long term outcomes and  their predictors are poorly described in these patients. The primary aim is to  describe characteristics and predictors of Long Covid in children assessed  in-clinics up to 36 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as investigate the  role of vaccines in preventing Long Covid, risk of reinfections and development  of autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Children aged 0-18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were  invited for a prospective follow-up assessment at a peadiatric post-covid clinic  in Rome, Italy, at serial intervals (3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 36-months  post-infection onset, between 01/02/2020 and 28/02/2024). Long Covid was defined  as persistence of otherwise unexplained symptoms for at least three months after  initial infection. FINDINGS: 1319 patients were initially included, 1296 reached the 3 months  follow-up or more. Of the patients who underwent multiple follow-ups, 23.2%  (301), 169 (13.2%), 89 (7.9%), 67 (6.1%), 47 (7.1%) were diagnosed with Long  Covid at 3-6-12-18-24 months, respectively For the primary outcome of Long Covid  at three months, age >12 years (P < 0.001, OR 11.33, 95% CI 4.2; 15.15),  comorbidities (P = 0.008, OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.06; 2.44), being infected with  original variants (P < 0.001, OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.46; 14.47), female sex  (P < 0.001, OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.02; 1.89) were statistically significant risk  factors. Age >12 years (P = 0.002, OR 9.37, 95% CI 1.58; 8.64), and infection  with original (P = 0.012, OR 3.52, 95% CI 1.32; 8.64) and alfa (P < 0.001, OR  4.09, 95% CI 2.01; 8.3) SARS-CoV-2 variants remained statistically significant  risk factors for Long Covid duration for at least 18 months. Vaccination was  associated with a lower risk of long covid at 3, 6 and 12 months for older  children and a lower risk of reinfections. Being infected with the original  SARS-CoV-2 variant was associated with a higher risk of new-onset autoimmune  diseases ((P = 0.035, 95% CI 1.12; 2.4). One patient was diagnosed with Long  Covid after a re-infection. INTERPRETATION: This is the longest follow-up study of children with SARS-CoV-2  infection, showing a significant and long-lasting burden of Long Covid in the  pediatric population. Our findings highlight the urgent need of investing in  pediatric Long Covid in order to find effective diagnostic and therapeutic  approaches, as well can inform preventive strategies in case of future  pandemics.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve with recent variants such  as the omicron sub-variants potentially exhibiting increased transmissibility.  Of note, the XBB.1.5 variant has been associated with vaccine-breakthrough  cases. We utilised the same platform previously used to develop CORBEVAX™, an  ancestral Wuhan strain COVID-19 RBD subunit vaccine, to now develop an XBB.1.5  RBD subunit vaccine. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the new  XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine compared to an ancestral Wuhan strain RBD subunit  vaccine. METHODS: This prospective, single-blind, phase 3 randomised controlled trial was  conducted in participants aged 5-80 years. Participants who had not received any  other approved COVID-19 vaccine within the last 6 months were enrolled and  randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive two booster doses of either the test  vaccine or the control vaccine. The vaccines were administered on Day 0 and Day  28 with immunogenicity assessments on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. Safety  assessments included the collection of solicited and unsolicited adverse events  (AEs) up to Day 56. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate  immunogenic superiority of the test vaccine booster series compared to the  control vaccine series. This superiority objective was to be met if the lower  limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the anti-XBB.1.5.RBD neutralising antibody  (nAb) geometric mean titre (GMT) ratio of test: control was >1.0 on either Day  28 or Day 42. Given the emergence of JN.1 as the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain  during the conduct of this study, Day 42 anti-JN.1 nAb levels were measured in a  post hoc immunogenicity assessment. In addition, anti-XBB.1.5 RBD protein IgG  concentrations were also measured by ELISA on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. The  trial was registered at Clinical Trials Registry-India as CTRI/2024/01/061423. FINDINGS: A total of 360 participants (32.8% female) were enrolled and  randomised across seven sites in India. The nAb GMT ratio of test: control  participants was 2.08 (95% CI 1.64-2.63) on Day 28 and 2.91 (95% CI 2.38-3.56)  on Day 42. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of neutralising antibodies (nAb)  was 7.637 (95% CI 6.090-9.578) on Day 28 and 17.02 (95% CI 13.79-21.01) on Day  42 in the test booster series arm. The nAb GMFRs in the control booster series  arm at the same time points were 3.033 (95% CI 2.340-3.932) and 4.824 (95% CI  3.731-6.236), respectively. Post hoc analyses revealed an nAb GMT ratio of 1.90  (95% CI 1.56-2.31) for test: control against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain. The  safety profile of the new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be very  similar to that of the ancestral strain vaccine with 59 AEs (about 1 AE for  every 8 doses administered) and 27 AEs (a little less than 1 AE for every 8  doses administered) respectively during the study. No serious AEs or AEs of  special interest were reported in either the test or control arm of the study.  Two cases of pyrexia required medical attention, one in each arm. INTERPRETATION: The new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be both safe  and robustly immunogenic when administered as a two-dose booster series in  individuals aged 5-80 years. In particular, the vaccine induced a significant  rise in neutralising antibodies against the XBB.1.5 strain as well as  cross-protective neutralising antibodies against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain.  These data are in line with studies of other XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines and  support a positive risk-benefit profile. Real-world studies may provide  additional evidence about the effectiveness of this new updated vaccine. FUNDING: Biological E Limited, India.  © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: According to the WHO, 278 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 had  been recorded worldwide by the end of 2021, resulting in approximately 5.4  million deaths. In Burkina Faso, 17,632 cases and 318 deaths were recorded.  Vaccination is one of the strategies implemented to control the pandemic. This  study aimed to evaluate the status of the COVID-19 vaccination program among  staff at a referral hospital in Burkina Faso. METHODS: From June 2 to December 31, 2021, we conducted a descriptive study at  Tengandogo University Hospital (CHU-T). The study involved all staff members.  Information was obtained through face-to-face and telephone interviews and  self-administered questionnaires. Quantitative variables were described using  the mean and standard deviation, while qualitative variables were described  using proportions. All vaccinated individuals responded to the questionnaire.  Unvaccinated individuals were volunteers. RESULTS: A total of 31% (174 out of 559) of healthcare workers were vaccinated,  with a mean age of 41 ± 8 years. Men accounted for 55% (94/174) of the  vaccinated workers. The main worker profiles were 62 doctors (35.6%), 62 nurses  (35.6%), and nine ward boys and girls (5.2%). The main reason for accepting the  vaccine was protection against the disease, reported by 132 workers (76%). There  were 134 unvaccinated subjects who agreed to participate in the study. Their  average age was 32.8 ± 7.3 years. The proportion of women was 60%. Uncertainty  about vaccine effectiveness was the main reason for not getting vaccinated,  cited by 106 workers (79%). Minor adverse events were reported by 136 of the  vaccinated workers (78%). No serious adverse events were reported. Four  vaccinated workers developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study  period. CONCLUSION: The proportion of vaccinated subjects was low. Interventions to  improve healthcare workers' adherence to vaccination should be developed.  INTRODUCTION: Selon l'OMS, fin 2021, 278 millions de cas confirmés de Covid-19  ont été enregistrés dans le monde avec environ 5,4 millions de décès. Au Burkina  Faso, ce sont 17 632 cas avec 318 décès qui ont été enregistrés. La vaccination  est une des stratégies mise en place pour lutter contre cette pandémie.  L'objectif de l'étude était de faire un état des lieux de la vaccination contre  la Covid-19 chez le personnel d'un hôpital de référence du Burkina Faso. MÉTHODES: Nous avons conduit une étude descriptive allant du 2 juin 2021 au 31  décembre 2021 au CHU de Tengandogo (CHU-T). Elle a concerné l'ensemble du  personnel. Les informations ont été obtenues par entretien face à face,  téléphonique et par questionnaires autoadministrés. Les variables quantitatives  ont été décrites en utilisant la moyenne et l'écart type et les variables  qualitatives en utilisant la proportion. Toutes les personnes vaccinées ont  répondu au questionnaire. Les personnes non vaccinées étaient des volontaires. RÉSULTATS: Au total 31 % (174/559) des agents de santé ont été vaccinés; leur  âge moyen était de 41 ± 8 ans. Les hommes représentaient 55 % (94/174) des  agents vaccinés. Parmi les agents, les principaux profils étaient représentés  par 62 (35,6 %) médecins, 62 (35,6 %) infirmiers, 9 (5,2 %) garçons et filles de  salle. La principale raison d'acceptation de la vaccination était la protection  contre la maladie enregistrée chez 132 agents soit 76 %. Les sujets non vaccinés  ayant accepté de participer à l'étude étaient au nombre de 134. L'âge moyen  était 32,8 ±7,3 ans. La proportion de femmes était de 60 %. L'incertitude  concernant l'efficacité des vaccins a été la principale raison de la  non-vaccination notée chez 106 agents 79 % (106/134). Des évènements  indésirables mineurs ont été signalés chez 136 agents vaccinés soit 78 %. Aucun  évènement indésirable grave n'a été signalé. Quatre agents vaccinés ont  développé la Covid-19 au cours de la période de l'étude. CONCLUSION: La proportion des sujets vaccinés était faible. Des interventions  visant à améliorer l'adhésion des agents de santé à la vaccination devraient  être développées.  Copyright © 2025 SFMTSI.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines exhibit more rapid declines in  antibody levels than other vaccine platforms, likely owing to transient antigen  exposure and limited germinal center persistence. Moreover, although homologous  boosting effectively restores humoral immunity, concerns persist regarding  potential T cell exhaustion with repeated antigen exposure. We evaluated the  effectiveness of delayed homologous CoronaVac booster immunization in  reactivating immune memory. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 83 healthy  adults who received two CoronaVac vaccine doses (14-day interval) and a  homologous booster shot after 12 months. Peripheral blood samples were collected  0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after booster vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies were  analysed using live-virus microneutralization assays. Anti-receptor-binding  domain immunoglobulin subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) were detected using  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine secretion (interferon  [IFN]-γ/interleukin [IL]-2/IL-4/IL-5) was assessed using enzyme-linked  immunospot assay. T cell polarization and exhaustion markers (T-bet/GATA3 and  CD69/CTLA-4/PD-1) were evaluated using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies reached 254.5 on  day 14. The initial immune response was dominated by IgG3, which subsequently  shifted to IgG1. A significant Th1-type cellular immune response was  characterized by increased IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion, and upregulated T-bet  expression. Transient CD69+ T cell activation occurred between days 3 and 10  without sustained PD-1 and CTLA-4 elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed homologous CoronaVac booster immunization effectively  reactivates immune memory, facilitated by Th1 polarization and transient T cell  activation, which do not result in T cell exhaustion. These findings suggest the  potential application of long-interval immunization strategies against COVID-19.  Copyright © 2025 Song, Chen, Bai, Lv, Wang, Zhang, Wu and Zhao.

METHODS: Between July 21, 2020, and July 29, 2021, 13,166 participants provided  informed consent, with 12,688 randomized for the trial. Participants were  allocated between vaccine and placebo arms (1:1) and monitored for symptomatic  COVID-19 cases, severity of disease, and adverse reactions after two doses given  14 days apart. FINDINGS: The primary efficacy analysis revealed a vaccine efficacy of 50⸱4 %  (95 % confidence interval [CI], 35·3 % to 62·0 %; p = 0·0049) in preventing  symptomatic COVID-19, leading to the issuance of Emergency Use Authorization for  CoronaVac in January 2021. Upon completion of follow-up, vaccine efficacy was  44⸱6 % [95 % CI, 34·9 % to 52·8 %; p = 0·0023] in preventing COVID-19 and 82⸱1 %  (95 % CI, 64·9 % to 90·9 %; p < 0·0001) in preventing severe COVID-19. Safety  data indicated that adverse reactions were more frequent in the vaccine arm,  primarily mild to moderate, with pain at the injection site and headache being  the most common. INTERPRETATION: CoronaVac demonstrated moderate efficacy in preventing  symptomatic COVID-19 and high efficacy against severe disease. While reactions  were slightly more common in the vaccine group, they were generally mild and  manageable.

PURPOSE: The current novel coronavirus disease pandemic was declared by the  World Health Organization in 2020. Considering the difference in the infection  and mortality rates in healthcare workers in Iran compared to other countries,  as well as the diversity of vaccines used and their effectiveness, this study  was conducted to investigate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  vaccination on the viral loads and symptoms of healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, viral loads of first  and breakthrough COVID-19 infections of Imam Reza and Mohammad Kermanshahi  Hospital personnel were measured before and after full dose COVID-19  vaccination, through measuring delta cycle threshold (ΔCt), an inverse measure  of viral load, from 2020 to 2021 in Kermanshah, Iran. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction test results of 110 cases with an average age  of 35.15±8.04 were compared. Female participants were 71 (64.5%), and the rest  were male. Breakthrough viral loads were significantly lower than first  infection (mean ΔCt, 22.04±4.59 vs. 26.61±3, p<0.001). Cough, fever, chills, and  myalgia frequencies were significantly decreased in breakthrough infections  (p<0.05), except for dyspnea. Gastrointestinal symptoms remained the same, and  anosmia frequency increased in breakthrough infections. Viral loads based on  vaccine type and clinical symptoms were significantly reduced (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccination could be  effective in reducing the viral loads and frequency of clinical symptoms in  Iranian healthcare workers.  © Korean Vaccine Society, Korean Society for Zoonoses.

BACKGROUND: Supply constraints during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic led to vaccination strategies that prioritized first-dose coverage. To  evaluate the merit of this approach, this study compared the development of  protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection and severe COVID-19 following a single dose versus two doses across  three widely used vaccine platforms. METHODS: National, matched, test-negative case-control analyses were conducted  in Qatar between December 1, 2020, and December 18, 2021, to evaluate vaccine  effectiveness. The one-dose analysis included 227,309 cases and 4,170,786  controls; the two-dose analysis included 234,314 cases and 6,445,858 controls. RESULTS: For BNT162b2, single-dose effectiveness against infection increased  steadily from 9.9 % (95 % CI: 6.7-13.0 %) in the first two weeks  post-vaccination to 71.5 % (95 % CI: 45.5-85.1 %) by month 3, closely  approaching the 74.5 % (95 % CI: 72.9-76.0 %) effectiveness observed after the  two-dose primary series. Similar trends were observed for mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1  nCoV-19, with mRNA-1273 reaching two-dose levels of effectiveness as early as  month 2. In contrast to the gradual buildup of protection against infection,  single-dose effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 increased  rapidly for all three vaccines, exceeding 85 % by day 21 and closely matching  the protection achieved after two doses. CONCLUSION: A single COVID-19 vaccine dose provides rapid, strong protection  against severe outcomes, supporting first-dose prioritization during supply  constraints. The slower development of protection against infection highlights  the second dose's role in accelerating the immune response. Antigen dose appears  to influence the speed of protection buildup.

INTRODUCTION: Studies assessing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness have generally  categorized individuals into 'vaccinated' and 'unvaccinated' groups. Long-term  safety studies are sparse and have usually compared adverse events with  background rates. Studies on timing of COVID-19 vaccination as a determinant of  long COVID have provided variable results, while there is scarce data on timing  of vaccination as a determinant of adverse events. AREAS COVERED: We discuss some of our observations as well as the global  evidence on the timing of COVID-19 vaccination as a determinant of long-COVID  and adverse events. This special report is hypothesis-generating and aims to  propose a conceptual framework and not establish causality. EXPERT OPINION: We propose an alternative classification strategy for COVID-19  vaccinees, with special emphasis on individuals who received any dose of  vaccination after recovering from natural COVID-19, i.e. the  'vaccine-after-COVID' (VAC) group. These individuals should be followed up for  an extended period through multicentric and database studies. This may help in  understanding the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the natural course  of long COVID. Immunological characteristics of this group should also be  scrutinized. The evidence gained might be useful in planning vaccination  policies in the event of future pandemics.  DOI: 10.1080/14740338.2025.2542249 PMID: 40737552"

(3)College of Law, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. (4)School of Sociology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.  Exploring the influencing factors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and summarizing  countermeasures is of great significance for effectively addressing potential  public health crises. Based on survey data from China, we employed a Gradient  Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model and conducted SHAP interpretability  analysis. The results show that in the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, the  important factors include social norms, vaccine knowledge, anticipated regret,  age, vaccine safety, social responsibility, education level, religious belief,  vaccine effectiveness, and perceived severity. While for booster shots, the  important variables include age, vaccination experience, vaccine knowledge,  vaccine effectiveness, gender, perceived severity, concerns about the epidemic,  social norms, anticipated regret, and sense of social responsibility. The  differences in the composition and significance of these core predictive factors  suggest that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is dynamically evolving. This pattern of  evolution is manifested as a shift in the decision - making basis from social  norms to subjective experiences, in the focus of vaccines from safety - first to  effectiveness - priority, and in the decision - making mechanism from emotion -  dominated to cognition - driven. The research findings inspire us that when  formulating vaccination strategies, multiple factors need to be comprehensively  considered. Moreover, strategies should be adjusted in a timely manner according  to changes in the vaccination stages to align with the shift in public concerns  and decision - making mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: The covid-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented global effort to  develop and deploy vaccines, including CoronaVac, an inactivated virus-based  vaccine. While these vaccines effectively reduced severe cases and  hospitalizations, limited data exists on their immunogenicity in younger  populations, particularly children and adolescents. Understanding the immune  response in these groups is essential to guide vaccination strategies and assess  protection against emerging variants of concern, such as Omicron subvariants  BA.1 and BA.5. This study evaluated the neutralizing antibody response in  children and adolescents aged 3-17 years over 12 months following the two-dose  CoronaVac protocol in Brazil. METHODS: A cohort of 108 children (3-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years)  from Serrana, Brazil, received two doses of CoronaVac. Peripheral blood samples  were collected at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the second dose.  Participants were stratified by serostatus prior to vaccination. Neutralizing  antibodies against Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 were assessed using microneutralization  assays. RESULTS: Neutralizing antibody titers increased significantly after vaccination  in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. For seronegative  participants, seroconversion rates for BA.5 rose from 16.6% pre-vaccination to  93.3% one month after the second dose in children, and from 50% to 92% in  adolescents, with sustained levels for 12 months. Seropositive participants also  showed enhanced antibody titers, particularly against BA.5. No significant  differences in neutralization between BA.1 and BA.5 were observed  post-vaccination, contrary to prior literature, suggesting uniform effectiveness  against these subvariants. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that CoronaVac significantly enhances and  sustains neutralizing antibody titers in children and adolescents for up to one  year, including against immune-evading subvariants like BA.5. The robust  response highlights the vaccine's potential as a critical tool for reducing  SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preventing severe disease, particularly in regions  with limited access to updated vaccines. Further studies with larger cohorts are  needed to validate these findings and inform vaccination strategies for  immunoresistant variants.

INTRODUCTION: Mass media plays a key role in shaping medical discourses on a  societal level, and understanding this role could inform context-specific  approaches to address current health challenges. However, public health  scholarship that focuses on low- and middle-income countries, draws on media  analytic approaches established in other fields, or utilises the potential of  digital platforms for understanding non-print mass media remains limited. One  context meriting a better understanding of media communication is vaccination in  the Philippines, where large-scale discourses have repeatedly challenged vaccine  confidence. METHODS: To understand how vaccine information has been communicated on  Philippine TV broadcasts, we systematically searched and extracted n=108  broadcasts using YouTube API queries. Our approach covered 16 years of  broadcasting throughout three major waves of vaccination reporting including  routine communication, the Dengvaxia controversy and its fallout, and the  COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a content analysis of the full dataset, followed  by an in-depth qualitative framing analysis of 16 purposively selected  broadcasts. RESULTS: Our results highlight how broadcasts across periods of varying  discourse intensity were generally pro-vaccine leaning. However, key vaccine  information, such as regarding the safety and efficacy of immunisation, was  often lacking. Framing of vaccination varied within and across broadcasts and  over time as communication stakeholders (including broadcasters, medical or  scientific professionals, political actors, and lay individuals) employed  medical (eg, providing explanations of disease risks or vaccine functioning),  political (eg, suggesting accountability and highlighting actions taken) and  social frames (eg, emphasising belonging and community-level relevance). CONCLUSION: Vaccine messaging changes based on shifting societal discourses,  stakeholders and communication objectives. Training health professionals to  emphasise under-represented information and to purposively engage with prominent  message frames could improve vaccination communication. Beyond vaccine  hesitancy, our results also highlight how methodological advances can guide  public health stakeholders analysing societal discourses and seeking to convey  medical information to the broader population.

Author information: (1)Department of Immunobiology and Biomedicine, Sirius University of Science and  Technology, 354349 Sirius, Krasnodarsky Krai, Russia.  The emergence of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) virus closely related to SARS-CoV and officially known as  Betacoronavirus pandemicum precipitated a substantial surge in vaccine  development that culminated during the global COVID-19 pandemic. At present,  there are dozens of vaccines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 being utilized  across the globe. However, only 10 of these vaccines have been authorized by the  World Health Organization (WHO). These include mRNA-based, viral vector, subunit  and whole-virion inactivated vaccines. At the current end of the pandemic, there  has been a decline in the global vaccination rate, both for the general  population and for those most at risk of severe illness from the virus. This  suggests that the effectiveness of the vaccines may be waning. The decline  occurs alongside a decrease in testing and sequencing for SARS-CoV-2.  Furthermore, the process of tracking viruses becomes increasingly complex,  thereby providing a selective advantage for SARS-CoV-2 and allowing it to evolve  stealthily. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of viral  evolution and vaccine development. We also discuss ways to overcome viral  variability and test universal vaccines for all SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Impact of Vaccination and Public Health Measures on the Severity of SARS-CoV-2  Omicron Infections in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression Analysis.

Author information: (1)WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control,  School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong  Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.  Background: Starting in early 2022, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron has driven large  outbreaks in China, a predominantly infection-naive population with high  inactivated vaccine coverage. This unique context provided a substantially  less-confounded opportunity to evaluate how vaccination, public health, and  social measures influenced severity. Methods: We systematically reviewed 86  studies (224 severity estimates) published from 2022 to 2024, reporting symptom  and clinical severity outcomes (fever, cough, and sore throat; symptomatic,  severe/critical, and fatal illness) of Omicron infections in China. Using  meta-regression, we evaluated the associations of study setting, age group,  vaccination status, predominant subvariants, and Oxford COVID-19 Government  Response Tracker (OxCGRT) indices, including the Government Response Index  (GRI), Containment and Health Index (CHI), and the Stringency Index (SI), with  infection outcomes, adjusting for key confounders. Results: We found the primary  or booster series of inactivated vaccines conferred strong protection against  severe/critical illness (pooled relative risk (RR) 0.17 [95% CI: 0.09-0.33]) but  did not reduce symptom frequency (RR 0.99 [95% CI: 0.95-1.02]). Each 10-unit  increase in GRI or CHI was associated with 7% (95% CI: 1-12%) and 6% (95% CI:  1-10%) lower odds of symptomatic infection and 3% (95% CI: 1-4%) lower odds of  severe/critical illness. Later subvariants (BA.5, BF.7, and XBB) showed 24-38%  higher odds of upper respiratory symptoms versus BA.1. Conclusions: The data  collection context significantly impacted severity estimates, with higher  estimates from emergency hospitals. Overall, inactivated vaccines provided  strong protection against severe/critical outcomes while stringent public health  measures were associated with lower severity. Our findings underscore the  importance of consistent and standardized protocols to produce reliable  estimates of SARS-CoV-2 severity in evolving epidemiological contexts.

Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused sickness and death among  many health care workers. However, the apparent resistance of health care  workers to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite their high-risk work environment remains  unclear. To investigate if inflammation and circadian disruption contribute to  resistance or diminished susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we  retrospectively evaluated a cohort of volunteer hospital nurses (VHNs). Methods:  A total of 246 apparently healthy VHNs (mean age 37.4 ± 5.9 years) who had  received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine were asked to report their sleep quality,  according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and number of SARS-CoV-2  infections during the observational study period (from the end of December 2020  to April 2025). The expression of inflammation-associated mediators and  circadian transcription factors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well  as sleep quality, were examined. Results: Our findings revealed no  anthropometric, biochemical, or inflammation-associated parameters but  demonstrated significantly greater levels of NFE2L2, also known as nuclear  factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFR2), gene expression in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells among VHNs who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n =  97) than in VHNs with only one (n = 119) or with two or more (n = 35) prior  SARS-CoV-2 infections (p < 0.01). This result was confirmed through one-to-one  propensity score matching (p < 0.01). Moreover, NRF2 gene expression was not  associated with the number of COVID-19 vaccinations (p = 0.598). Finally, NRF2  gene expression was higher among participants who reported better sleep quality  (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest possible interactions among NRF2  gene expression, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the modulation of  COVID-19 vaccination efficacy.

Background: SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination remains essential to prevent severe  COVID-19, particularly in vulnerable populations such as older adults. This  study evaluated the durability and dynamics of immune responses following  booster vaccination(s) in >65-year-old individuals and examined their  association with protection against new infections. Methods: Immune responses  were evaluated at 3, 9, and 15 months post-booster, measuring  SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies against spike [IgG(S)] and nucleocapsid  [IgG(N)] proteins, neutralizing activity against the Omicron BA.2 variant, and  cellular immunity. A subset of participants was tested before booster  administration. Regression analyses examined the influence of clinical and  immunological factors-including a bivalent fourth dose-on infection risk over  time. Results: Booster vaccination significantly enhanced IgG(S) and  neutralizing capacity, peaking at 3 months. Although a decline was observed by 9  months, responses remained above baseline. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2  infection exhibited higher IgG(S) levels and neutralizing titers, and  significantly lower reinfection rates (15%), compared to uninfected individuals.  A fourth vaccine dose further increased IgG(S) levels. While neutralizing  capacity was not consistently enhanced by the fourth dose, recipients  experienced a lower rate of new infections. Immune trajectory analyses revealed  that breakthrough infections elicited strong humoral responses comparable to  those seen in previously infected individuals, highlighting the role of hybrid  immunity. Conclusions: In older adults, booster vaccination induces durable  immune responses, with hybrid immunity offering enhanced protection. A fourth  dose boosts antibody levels and reduces infection risk, supporting its use in  this high-risk group. Continued monitoring is needed to determine the long-term  effectiveness of boosters, particularly against emerging variants.

Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) represent a uniquely vulnerable  population due to intrinsic immunological dysfunction and a high prevalence of  comorbid conditions. This review examines the complex interplay between natural  and vaccine-induced immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in this group, focusing on  viral entry, immune activation, and immune evasion mechanisms. Particular  attention is given to the impaired cellular and humoral responses seen in PD  patients, including reduced T-cell function, diminished antibody production, and  abnormal cytokine signaling, all of which contribute to an elevated risk of  severe COVID-19 outcomes. The immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of various  vaccine platforms, including inactivated, vector-based, and mRNA formulations,  are critically assessed, with an emphasis on the role of booster doses in  enhancing protection amid waning immunity and evolving viral variants.  Furthermore, the review highlights the advantages of PD as a home-based modality  that is compatible with telemedicine and may reduce the risk of viral exposure.  These insights underscore the importance of developing individualized  vaccination strategies, maintaining close immunological surveillance, and  implementing innovative dialysis care approaches to improve clinical outcomes  during the ongoing pandemic and future public health crises. Tailored booster  strategies and telemedicine-integrated care models are essential for improving  outcomes in this high-risk population.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted extensive vaccination efforts  globally, yet in the Philippines, many families remained unvaccinated.  Caregivers are key decision-makers for family vaccination, but evidence on  factors influencing their own vaccine uptake is limited. Methods: A  cross-sectional survey of primary caregivers was conducted in low COVID-19  vaccine uptake regions in the Philippines from July to October 2023 using a  validated questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression identified enablers  and barriers to vaccine uptake. Results: Among 775 respondents, 72.3% completed  primary vaccination, 3.3% had incomplete vaccination, and 24.4% were  unvaccinated. Key factors for vaccination included self, family, and community  protection, and the influence of government regulations. Distrust in vaccine  safety was the main barrier. Positive associations with vaccine uptake were  found for age [30-45 years (aOR = 2.23) and 46-59 years (aOR = 2.84)], education  [secondary (aOR = 2.25) and tertiary (aOR = 4.93)], and employment (aOR = 1.99).  Confidence in vaccine safety (aOR = 1.92), vaccine effectiveness (aOR = 2.23),  and satisfaction with vaccination efforts (aOR = 2.39) were additional enablers.  Disagreement with restrictions on the unvaccinated was a barrier (aOR = 0.31).  Conclusions: This study identified multiple factors influencing COVID-19  vaccination among primary caregivers in low uptake areas of the Philippines.  Interventions addressing perceptions about vaccine safety and effectiveness,  particularly among younger and less educated caregivers, may improve public  trust and satisfaction with vaccination efforts.

BACKGROUND: While mRNA vaccines effectively limit hospitalization and severe  COVID-19 disease, the precise early innate immune mechanisms associated with  their efficacy and reactogenicity remain underexplored. The identification of  innate immune correlates prior to vaccination could provide mechanistic insights  and potentially predict responses. METHODS: We developed an in vitro model to study the innate immune activation of  pre-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from  participants enrolled in a well-characterized COVID-19 BioNTech/Pfizer BNT162b2  vaccine (BNT162b2 vaccine) cohort. Pre-vaccination PBMCs were stimulated with  empty lipid nanoparticle (LNP), mRNA-LNP, or Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists.  Using multiparameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the baseline immune  state, innate responsiveness to stimuli, and cytokine profiles of study  participants. These pre-vaccination in vitro results were analyzed for  correlations with post-vaccination symptoms and spike-specific IgG responses. RESULTS: Baseline dendritic cell (DC) states inversely correlated with the  magnitude of symptoms following BNT162b2 vaccination. Heightened conventional  (cDC) and weaker plasmacytoid DC (pDC) responses to RNA stimuli correlated with  the magnitude of an acute IgG response. IgG durability modestly correlated with  a lower pDC state but higher cDC2 and monocyte baseline states and inversely  correlated with TLR3 agonist responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-vaccination assessment of innate immune function and  resting states can be used to fit models potentially predictive of  immunogenicity and reactogenicity to BNT162b2 vaccination. Pre-vaccination DC  states may influence reactogenicity, while the response to RNA may impact  antibody responses. Our data suggest that pre-vaccination assessment offers  insights into the innate mechanisms driving mRNA vaccine responses and has  predictive potential.

Background and objective: The approval of mRNA-based vaccines for children and  adolescents has contributed to global efforts to control the SARS-CoV-2  pandemic. While hybrid immunity-combining prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and  vaccination-may offer enhanced protection, data on its effectiveness versus  vaccine-induced immunity in the pediatric population are limited. Methods: This  retrospective matched cohort study used linked health data from Norwegian  nationwide health registries and the Italian Pedianet network. The study  included children and adolescents aged 5-14 years eligible for COVID-19  vaccination at the time of approval (May/September 2021 and November  2021/January 2022, respectively). Mono- and two-dose vaccination schedules were  assessed, and hybrid immunity was defined as prior SARS-CoV-2 infection followed  by vaccination within 12 months. Conditional Cox regression models were used to  estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, adjusting for  sociodemographics, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization. Results: The study  included 626,537 children and adolescents in Norway and 38,938 in Italy. A  single dose of the vaccine did not reduce the risk of infection among  SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals in Norway (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), whereas it  was associated with an 8% risk reduction in Italy (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.96).  Among individuals with a recent prior infection (within 12 months), vaccination  was associated with a reduced risk of reinfection in Norway (HR: 0.10; 95% CI:  0.05-0.13), but not in Italy (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.83-1.80), compared to no  vaccination. Among those with prior infection, vaccination was associated with a  significantly reduced risk of reinfection in Norway (HR = 0.10; 95% CI:  0.05-0.20), but not in Italy (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.27-1.11). Hybrid immunity  provided greater protection against (re-)infection compared to vaccine-induced  immunity alone, with a 26% risk reduction observed in Norway (HR = 0.74; 95% CI  = 0.47-0.1.16) and an 86% reduction in Italy (HR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.09-0.21).  Conclusions: This analysis supports the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in  children, with hybrid immunity offering enhanced protection against reinfection.  Given the waning effectiveness of vaccines over time, continued research and  booster strategies are essential to sustain protection and mitigate  transmission.

Nguyen HN(1), Vanderzee IO(2), Wen F(1)(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109, USA. (2)Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109,  USA.  The development of vaccines against viral infections has advanced rapidly over  the past century, propelled by innovations in laboratory and molecular  technologies. These advances have expanded the range of vaccine platforms beyond  live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines to include recombinant platforms, such  as subunit proteins and virus-like particles (VLPs), and more recently,  mRNA-based vaccines, while also enhancing methods for evaluating vaccine  performance. Despite these innovations, a persistent challenge remains: the  inherent complexity and heterogeneity of immune responses continue to impede  efforts to achieve consistently effective and durable protection across diverse  populations. Single-cell technologies have emerged as transformative tools for  dissecting this immune heterogeneity, providing comprehensive and granular  insights into cellular phenotypes, functional states, and dynamic host-pathogen  interactions. In this review, we examine how single-cell epigenomic,  transcriptomic, proteomic, and multi-omics approaches are being integrated  across all stages of vaccine development-from infection-informed discovery to  guide vaccine design, to high-resolution evaluation of efficacy, and refinement  of cell lines for manufacturing. Through representative studies, we highlight  how insights from these technologies contribute to the rational design of more  effective vaccines and support the development of personalized vaccination  strategies.

Author information: (1)Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), York University,  4700 Keele St., Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada. (2)Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, 4700 Keele St.,  Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Despite significant advancements in vaccine development  and distribution, the optimal timing and integration of COVID-19 vaccination in  Canada remain crucial to public health. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to  evolve, determining effective timing strategies for booster doses is necessary  to sustain immunity, especially in high-risk populations. This systematic review  aims to critically evaluate the timing and co-administration strategies of  COVID-19 vaccines in Canada, comparing them with approaches in other G7 nations. METHODS: The review seeks to identify best practices to inform national  vaccination policies, with a particular focus on synchronizing COVID-19 and  seasonal influenza vaccinations. We systematically searched Scopus, PubMed,  Medline, and Web of Science (17 August 2021 to 7 July 2024) using the PECOS  framework. Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstracts, extracted key  data on immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety, and performed a narrative  synthesis on timing and co-administration outcomes. RESULTS: Evidence summarized across G7 countries reveals that most nations are  converging on annual or flexible booster schedules tailored to high-risk groups,  often aligning COVID-19 vaccination with influenza campaigns. Countries like  Canada, the UK, and the US have integrated these efforts, while others maintain  more independent or heterogeneous approaches. In addition, timely booster doses,  whether administered annually or more frequently in high-risk settings,  consistently reduce infection rates and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively support the continued evolution of  COVID-19 vaccination programs toward integrated, seasonally aligned strategies.  Future public health efforts can build on these lessons not only to sustain  protection against SARS-CoV-2 but also to strengthen preparedness for other  respiratory infections.

Narrative review synthesizes the most current literature on the SARS-CoV-2 XEC  variant, focusing on its genomic evolution, immune evasion characteristics,  epidemiological dynamics, and public health implications. To achieve this, we  conducted a structured search of the literature of peer-reviewed articles,  preprints, and official surveillance data from 2023 to early 2025, prioritizing  virological, clinical, and immunological reports related to XEC and its parent  lineages. Defined by the distinctive spike protein mutations, T22N and Q493E,  XEC exhibits modest reductions in neutralization in vitro, although current  evidence suggests that mRNA booster vaccines, including those targeting JN.1 and  KP.2, retain cross-protective efficacy against symptomatic and severe disease.  The XEC strain of SARS-CoV-2 has drawn particular attention due to its  increasing prevalence in multiple regions and its potential to displace other  Omicron subvariants, although direct evidence of enhanced replicative fitness is  currently lacking. Preliminary analyses also indicated that glycosylation  changes at the N-terminal domain enhance infectivity and immunological evasion,  which is expected to underpin the increasing prevalence of XEC. The XEC variant,  while still emerging, is marked by a unique recombination pattern and a set of  spike protein mutations (T22N and Q493E) that collectively demonstrate increased  immune evasion potential and epidemiological expansion across Europe and North  America. Current evidence does not conclusively associate XEC with greater  disease severity, although additional research is required to determine its  clinical relevance. Key knowledge gaps include the precise role of recombination  events in XEC evolution and the duration of cross-protective T-cell responses.  New research priorities include genomic surveillance in undersampled regions,  updated vaccine formulations against novel spike epitopes, and long-term  longitudinal studies to monitor post-acute sequelae. These efforts can be  augmented by computational modeling and the One Health approach, which combines  human and veterinary sciences. Recent computational findings (GISAID, 2024)  point to the potential of XEC for further mutations in under-surveilled  reservoirs, enhancing containment challenges and risks. Addressing the potential  risks associated with the XEC variant is expected to benefit from  interdisciplinary coordination, particularly in regions where genomic  surveillance indicates a measurable increase in prevalence.

Background/Objectives: Adult vaccination remains suboptimal, particularly among  older adults and individuals with chronic conditions. Hospitals represent a  strategic setting for improving vaccination coverage among these high-risk  populations. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated hospital-based  interventions aimed at enhancing vaccine uptake in adults aged ≥60 years or  18-64 years with at-risk medical conditions. Methods: We conducted a systematic  review and meta-analysis following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Searches in  PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus identified studies published in the last 10 years  evaluating hospital-based interventions reporting vaccination uptake. The risk  of bias was assessed using validated tools (NOS, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, QI-MQCS). A  meta-analysis was conducted for categories with ≥3 eligible studies reporting  pre- and post-intervention vaccination coverage in the same population. Results:  We included 44 studies. Multi-component strategies (n = 21) showed the most  consistent results (e.g., pneumococcal uptake from 2.2% to 43.4%, p < 0.001).  Reminder-based interventions (n = 4) achieved influenza coverage increases from  31.0% to 68.0% and a COVID-19 booster uptake boost of +38% after SMS reminders.  Educational strategies (n = 11) varied in effectiveness, with one study  reporting influenza coverage rising from 1.6% to 12.2% (+662.5%, OR 8.86, p <  0.01). Standing order protocols increased pneumococcal vaccination from 10% to  60% in high-risk adults. Hospital-based catch-up programs improved DTaP-IPV  uptake from 56.2% to 80.8% (p < 0.001). For patient education, the pooled OR was  2.11 (95% CI: 1.96-2.27; p < 0.001, I2 = 97.2%) under a fixed-effects model, and  2.47 (95% CI: 1.53-3.98; p < 0.001) under a random-effects model. For  multi-component strategies, the OR was 2.39 (95% CI: 2.33-2.44; p < 0.001, I2 =  98.0%) with fixed effects, and 3.12 (95% CI: 2.49-3.92; p < 0.001) with random  effects. No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: Hospital-based  interventions, particularly those using multi-component approaches, effectively  improve vaccine coverage in older and high-risk adults. Embedding vaccination  into routine hospital care offers a scalable opportunity to reduce disparities  and enhance population-level protection. Future policies should prioritize the  institutional integration of such strategies to support healthy aging and  vaccine equity.

The International Network of Special Immunization Services (INSIS) was  established to investigate the causes and risk factors of rare adverse events  following immunizations (AEFIs) and develop immunization strategies for  mitigating or preventing risk for individuals with prior AEFIs or at risk of  AEFIs. INSIS integrates clinical data with multi-omic technologies (e.g.,  transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) through a global consortium of  clinical networks, leading immunology, pharmacogenomics teams to uncover the  molecular mechanisms behind AEFIs. The network ensures accurate and standardized  data collection and analysis through rigorous data management and quality  assurance processes. INSIS also implements harmonized case definitions and  protocols for collecting data and samples related to rare AEFIs, such as  myocarditis, pericarditis, and Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and  Thrombosis (VITT) after COVID-19 vaccinations. This protocol outlines the  comprehensive approach to enhance risk-benefit assessments of vaccines across  populations, identify actionable biomarkers to inform discovery and development  of safe vaccines, and support personalized vaccination strategies.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by  profound immunosuppression resulting from both disease-related mechanisms and  treatment-induced immune dysfunction. This compromised immune status markedly  increases susceptibility to infections, a leading cause of morbidity and  mortality in MM patients. While vaccination represents a cornerstone of  infection prevention, standard immunization strategies often yield suboptimal  responses in this population. OBJECTIVES: This review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological  barriers and clinical effectiveness of vaccination in MM. We evaluate vaccines  targeting influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, and other relevant  pathogens, and explore determinants influencing vaccine efficacy, including  optimal timing, formulation, and patient-specific immune parameters. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing clinical  trials, retrospective cohort studies, expert consensus guidelines, and  population-based data. Extracted outcomes included serological responses,  infection-related events, and vaccine safety in MM patients. RESULTS: Patients with MM exhibit impaired vaccine responses due to  hypogammaglobulinemia, T- and B-cell dysfunction, and therapy-induced  lymphodepletion. Despite modest immunogenicity, influenza and pneumococcal  vaccines reduce respiratory infections and hospitalizations. Sequential  administration of PCV13 followed by PPSV23, as well as post-autologous stem cell  transplantation (ASCT) three-dose regimens, is associated with reduced pneumonia  incidence. COVID-19 vaccines elicit variable responses, particularly in patients  on anti-CD38 or BCMA-targeted therapies, highlighting the need for booster doses  and, in selected cases, prophylactic monoclonal antibodies. Vaccines against  herpes zoster, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B are also  recommended, particularly around ASCT. Immunophenotypic markers such as CD19+  B-cell and CD4+ T-cell counts are predictive of vaccine responsiveness,  supporting immune profiling as a tool for individualized vaccination planning. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination remains a critical component of infection prevention in  MM. Although immunogenicity may be attenuated, clinical benefits-namely, reduced  infection burden and healthcare utilization-support broad vaccine  implementation. A personalized approach, considering the treatment phase,  disease control, and immune status, is essential to optimize vaccine  effectiveness. Ongoing research into high-dose, adjuvanted, and next-generation  vaccines is critical to enhance protection in this vulnerable population.  © 2025 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: CoronaVac (Sinovac) was initially effective against symptomatic  COVID-19 and severe outcomes, but its performance against the immune-evasive  Omicron variant remains uncertain. This study evaluated the effectiveness of  CoronaVac against hospitalized COVID-19 among Filipino adults during the  Omicron-dominant wave. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study  from November 2022 to November 2023 in three tertiary government hospitals in  the Philippines. Adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were  enrolled. Cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR; controls tested  negative. Vaccination status was confirmed via vaccination cards or the national  registry. Conditional logistic regression estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE).  Genomic sequencing identified circulating variants. RESULTS: Among 2,365 participants, 165 (7.0%) were COVID-19 positive. In an  age-matched analysis (104 cases, 408 controls), two CoronaVac doses provided  61.3% protection (95% CI: 5.3-84.2%) against critical illness. A heterologous  booster conferred 65.9% protection against severe disease, 90.1% against  critical illness, and 60.5% against death. Sequencing of 23/46 samples confirmed  Omicron XBB-like variants. CONCLUSION: Two doses of CoronaVac offered moderate protection against severe  COVID-19. Heterologous boosters significantly improved protection, especially  against critical illness and death, supporting ongoing booster campaigns after  inactivated vaccine priming.

This nationwide cross-sectional online survey aimed to assess coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy, self-reported adverse events (SRAEs),  and associated determinants among Ethiopian healthcare professionals (HCPs)  during the pandemic (June 19-July 31, 2021). This survey collected data from 674  HCPs after the COVID-19 vaccine's first dose became available in Ethiopia.  Hesitancy to the first and second vaccine doses was 45.6% and 17.6% among  unvaccinated and vaccinated participants, respectively. Fear of side effects  (39.9%) and doubts about vaccine effectiveness (29.7%) were the primary reasons  for hesitancy toward the first COVID-19 vaccine dose. For the second dose,  hesitancy stemmed from perceived lack of difference between vaccinated and  unvaccinated individuals (8.4%) and post-first-dose COVID-19 infection (6.4%).  The factors associated with hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (first  dose) were being Muslim (p = 0.026), belief about the origin of COVID-19  (p < 0.001), attributing the pandemic to God/Allah's wrath (p = 0.020), failure  to maintain physical distance (p = 0.029), and lack of access to the first dose  of the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.001). Moreover, religion (Muslim, [p = 0.049])  and frequency of maintaining physical distance (i.e., often/usually,  [p = 0.025]) were associated with second-dose COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Muslim  HCPs had 63% lower odds of first-dose hesitancy (AOR = 0.37, 95% confidence  interval [CI]: 0.16-0.89). Hesitancy increased among those who never maintained  physical distancing (AOR = 4.74, 95% CI: 1.18-19.08) and those with vaccine  access (AOR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.98-10.00). Pain at the injection site (55.3%) and  fatigue (44.4%) were the most frequently reported SRAEs among the vaccinated  HCPs. The factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine SRAEs were religion (others)  (p = 0.04), work experience > 7 years (p = 0.03), monthly income between 3000  and 10,000 (p = 0.03), and living with other people (p = 0.04). Addressing  safety concerns, enhancing transparency, and leveraging religious/community  engagement are critical to improving vaccine uptake among HCPs.  © 2025 The Author(s).

Covid-19 remains a global threat due to vaccine-waning immune responses, and the  need to update to emerging variants. This study presents the post-unblinding  analysis of the PROFISCOV trial (NCT04456595), a double-blind, randomized,  placebo-controlled phase 3, among adult healthcare workers (HCWs≥18y). A cohort  (N = 12,688) was randomized to receive a two-dose regimen of the inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac) or placebo (1:1), 14 days apart. ANVISA granted  emergency use authorization for CoronaVac in January 2021, prompting the study's  unblinding. Outcomes included incidence of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 cases  (RT-PCR), immune response over one year, and effects of boosters among the  vaccinees. Population (N = 1554) exhibited a reduction in confirmed cases from  November 2021, peaking from December 2021 to February 2022, when the Omicron  wave prevailed.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study among non-immunocompromised adults from  August 22, 2024 (""index"") to December 31, 2024, among residents of California or  Louisiana continuously enrolled in health insurance plans reporting to  HealthVerity for ≥1 year prior to index. Receipt of 2024-2025 BNT162b2 COVID-19  vaccine was defined using state vaccine registries with health insurance claims,  using a time-varying exposure definition. VE against COVID-19-associated  hospital admissions was estimated as (1-hazard ratio), using adjusted Cox  proportional hazards models with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Overall, 6,900,361 individuals met selection criteria for the study. By  the end of follow-up (median 4.4 months), 325,362 (4.7 %) had received a  BNT162b2 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. VE against COVID-19-associated  hospital admission was 41 % (95 % CI 2-64). DISCUSSION: The 2024-2025 formulation of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine provided  significant protection, particularly for older adults, in mid-season estimates.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),  identified in late 2019, spurred a global pandemic, prompting an unprecedented  international mobilization in vaccination and public health strategies. Although  the pandemic is now under greater control, the worldwide dissemination of  variants of concern (VOCs) has led to resistance and decreased vaccine efficacy,  highlighting the urgent need for broad-spectrum therapeutic and preventive  solutions. In this study, we employed hybridoma technology to generate  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from mice immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Spike  protein trimer. We selected clones producing anti-Spike receptor-binding domain  (RBD) mAbs and characterized a panel of four mAbs to assess their potential as  antiviral agents and their utility as tools in research and diagnostics. Our  results showed that all mAbs recognized the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain in infected  cells through immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, the binding profiles of these  mAbs against the RBD protein from various SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed distinct  reactivity and loss of binding as VOCs emerged. However, one mAb, named 4B1D3,  showed the most promising features, exhibiting broad binding and neutralizing  capacity across all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.2, BA.4/5  and XBB.1.5 sublineages. Furthermore, a single prophylactic dose of the 4B1D3  mAb provided protection to K18-hACE2 mice against a lethal challenge with  SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. In conclusion, these mAbs represent valuable tools for  research and diagnostics and have significant potential for the development of  new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

IMPORTANCE: Estimating global lives and life-years saved is important to put  into perspective the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Prior studies have  focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, and lack  crucial life-year calculations and often depend on strong modeling assumptions  with unaccounted uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: To calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination  worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 1, 2024. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study  considered different strata of the worldwide population according to age,  community-dwelling and long-term care residence status, pre-Omicron and Omicron  periods, and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPOSURES: Any COVID-19 vaccination in any schedule and number of doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death. RESULTS: In the main analysis, more than 2.5 million deaths were averted (1  death averted per 5400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were  among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were during the Omicron  period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years or older. Sensitivity analyses  suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives were saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed  a preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. An estimated 14.8  million life-years were saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses  administered). The sensitivity range was 7.4 to 23.6 million life-years. Most  life-years saved (76%) were among people 60 years or older, but long-term care  residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of  lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults aged 20 through 29  years (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small  contributions to the total benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Estimates in this study are substantially more  conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of  vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from  COVID-19 vaccination during the years 2020-2024. Most benefits in lives and  life-years saved was secured for a portion of older persons, a minority of the  global population.

Vaxtherapy, a Multiphase Therapeutic Protocol Approach for Longvax, the COVID-19  Vaccine-Induced Disease: Spike Persistence as the Core Culprit and Its  Downstream Effects.  Crespo-Barrios J(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Proteomics, Regeneratics, 28019 Madrid, Spain.  Background/Objectives: Chronic illness after COVID-19 vaccination (longvax)  lacks a therapeutic protocol anchored in pathophysiology. Persistent vaccine  derived spike protein appears to trigger microvascular fibrin amyloid  microclots, immune dysfunction, pathogen reactivation and multisystem injury.  This article proposes an integrative approach, Vaxtherapy, to tackle these  mechanisms. Methods: A narrative synthesis of peer reviewed literature from 2021  to 2025 on spike related injury and vaccine adverse events was conducted,  supplemented by clinical case series and mechanistic observations from long  COVID. The findings were arranged into a four stage therapeutic sequence ordered  by pathophysiological precedence. Results: Stage one aims to reopen hypoperfused  tissue through oral fibrinolytics that degrade fibrin amyloid resistant  microclots; stage two intends to neutralise circulating or tissue bound spike  via a receptor binding domain monoclonal antibody cocktail; stage three seeks to  eliminate reactivated viral or microbial reservoirs with targeted antivirals or  antimicrobials once perfusion is improved; and stage four aspires to support  tissue repair with mitochondrial supplements and, when indicated, cell based  therapies. Omitting or reordering stages may reduce efficacy or foster  resistance. Conclusions: This hypothesis driven framework outlines a  biologically plausible roadmap for longvax research. By matching interventions  to specific mechanisms (fibrinolysis, spike neutralisation, pathogen clearance  and regeneration), it aims to guide controlled trials and compassionate pilot  programs directed at durable recovery rather than chronic symptom management.

This study experimentally tests the impact of providing information about  vaccine safety and efficacy delivered by Black health care professionals. We  find that providing general information increases vaccination rates after  5 months by 8 percentage points (17%), driven by a 9.8 pp (24%) increase among  white participants. Political affiliation emerges as a key moderator to explain  this discordant effect. Across race, general information is more effective for  politically moderate and conservative respondents, most of whom are white. Among  this most vaccine-hesitant group, the information effectively addresses concerns  about both side effects and unknown long-run effects due to the fast approval of  the vaccine, increasing vaccination rates by 14 pp.  © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen the emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2  variants, each posing distinct public health challenges. The XEC variant, a  recombinant Omicron subvariant, has rapidly gained prevalence globally, raising  critical questions about its potential implications on health systems and public  policy. This paper examines the emergence, spread, and unique characteristics of  XEC, especially in the context of the global decline of KP.3.1.1, another  significant Omicron lineage. We discussed the public health implications,  including vaccine effectiveness, genomic surveillance, and healthcare system  preparedness, underscoring the need for adaptive strategies in response to  evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.  © 2025.

Electronic address: yaohangping@zju.edu.cn.  Vaccine immunization strategies are crucial for eliciting vaccine-induced immune  responses, particularly in immunocompromised and elderly populations. In  clinical practice in China, the polysaccharide nucleic acid fraction of Bacillus  Calmette-Guérin (BCG-PSN) is extensively used as an immunomodulatory agent.  Herein, we describe a new immunization strategy using the SARS-CoV-2 antigen  (original strain) with aluminum adjuvant and BCG-PSN. We evaluated whether  BCG-PSN enhances humoral and cellular immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  in K18-hACE2 and BALB/c mice by assessing antibody and germinal center (GC)  responses, as well as the quantity and functionality of memory T cells in the  spleen. At day 28 after the first immunization, the SARS-CoV-2 antigen with  Alum, when combined with BCG-PSN, significantly elevated the levels of IgG  antibodies. It significantly enhanced the spleen's GC structure, amplified the  SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cell response, and conferred protection to mice  against the Delta variant challenge. This study provides a reference to evaluate  immunization strategies for vaccines with high immunological efficacy, and the  SARS-CoV-2 antigen combined with Alum and BCG-PSN enhances immunogenicity by  significantly boosting cellular immune responses after vaccine administration.  The study focuses on the BCG-PSN vaccine's impact on SARS-CoV-2, examining its  role in generating neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and eliciting a T cell  response.  Copyright © 2025.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Mbeya Zonal Referral Hospital, Mbeya,  Tanzania. (2)Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Dar es Salaam-Mbeya  College of Health and Allied Sciences, Mbeya, Tanzania.  COVID-19 has caused about 580 million cases and 6.4 million deaths worldwide by  August 8th, 2022, including 8.7 million cases (173,063 deaths) in Africa. East  Africa reported 1.39 million cases on July, 2022. Tanzania confirmed 37,865  cases and 841 deaths by 8th August 2022. Although billions of vaccine doses  administered globally, just 17.6% of Tanzanians are fully vaccinated.  Symptomatic pregnant women face a mortality risk that is 70% higher than in  non-pregnant women.. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing knowledge,  attitude, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant women in the Mbeya  region. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Obstetrics and  Gynecology department of MZRH. Three scores were calculated for participants'  knowledge, attitude, and acceptance to COVID-19 vaccination. These scores were  compared to many sample factors using binary logistic regression and the  chi-square test. The study recruited 233 participants. Most participants (31.3%)  relied on social media for Covid-19 vaccine information. Poor Covid-19 vaccine  knowledge (71.2%), negative attitudes (76.8%), and low acceptance rate (38.6%)  were observed. Multivariate analysis showed that greater acceptance was  positively associated with having a chronic illness (AOR = 3.21, CI 1.448-7.123,  P = 0.004), stronger vaccine attitudes (AOR = 1.26, CI 1.149-1.368, P = 0.015),  better vaccine knowledge (AOR = 2.70, CI 2.587-2.810, P = 0.005), and prior  vaccination history (AOR = 0.13, CI 0.068-0.183, P = 0.000). Conversely,  preference for natural immunity (AOR = 0.42, CI 0.341-0.498, P = 0.018), and not  yet being vaccinated (AOR = 0.67, CI 0.594-0.755, P = 0.000) were all linked to  lower acceptance. Pregnant women exhibited low knowledge, attitude, and  acceptance to COVID-19 vaccines. Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine  causes pause. Education on COVID-19 vaccination is needed to enhance vaccine  uptake among pregnant women. This group must comprehend COVID-19 immunization  importance, safety, and efficacy.

The extensive use of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines has played a crucial role in controlling the Coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, underscoring the remarkable advantages and  efficacy of novel vaccine technologies. However, rare but life-threatening  cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis, pericarditis and thrombosis  have emerged, predominantly affecting young males following their second vaccine  dose. These adverse events highlight the importance of continued  pharmacovigilance and transparent communication about potential risks. As the  global epidemiological context has shifted, now characterized by widespread  natural, vaccine-induced, or hybrid immunity, it is important to re-evaluate the  risk-benefit ratio of repeated vaccine administration in low-risk individuals.  Data regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccines complications are still largely based on the  early phases of the pandemic (2020-2021), when population-level immunity was  minimal and severe COVID-19 outcomes more frequent. Today, such comparisons may  no longer be appropriate. Updated real-world evidence is needed to better inform  decision-making and ensure that public health strategies remain aligned with the  contemporary risk landscape.

BACKGROUND: Social media serves as a tool for increased digital  interconnectedness and has resulted in playing an instrumental role in sharing  health-related information with a wide audience. In conjunction with the vast  availability of information, there has been a rapid spread of misinformation,  leading to public mistrust, safety concerns, and discrimination. The COVID-19  pandemic has amplified the threat of misinformation resulting in detrimental  health outcomes due to individuals becoming fatigued with COVID-19 health  guidance. Although vaccinations are the key to combating COVID-19, the  overwhelming amount of misinformation has resulted in diminished vaccine  acceptance. This study aims to (1) train and deploy a group of health care workers and  student volunteers to address antivaccine sentiment on Facebook (Meta Platforms,  Inc) and (2) evaluate the intervention through semistructured interviews to  determine lessons learned and suggestions for future initiatives to address  internet-based misinformation online. METHODS: The project used volunteers to address vaccine-hesitant comments on  Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc), with the overall goal of empowering health care  professionals to counteract the spread of vaccine misinformation. Eligible  participants included health care workers and students in health care-related  disciplines recruited through social media and email advertising campaigns.  Informational training sessions followed, to better equip volunteers with the  ability to use their working knowledge of health communication and behavior  change to correct web-based misinformation. The volunteers were provided a file  containing Facebook posts that discussed COVID-19 vaccines to act as a starting  point for leaving or responding to comments that spread vaccine misinformation.  Participants were provided with working knowledge of health communication,  behavior change, and correct misinformation through the informational training  sessions. Qualitative evaluation in the form of interviews was used to examine  participant experiences. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged regarding the project's format and training  model, the factors motivating volunteers to participate, and overall experiences  tackling misinformation on a social media platform. The first theme showcased  that the training format was effective due to its use of interactive components  and overall flexibility, resulting in it being well received by volunteers. The  second identified theme highlighted that a main driving factor for participation  included a balance of professional development and societal good. The third  theme revealed that the volunteers' experiences in interacting with the public  revealed a rich tapestry of emotions and perspectives, where vaccine hesitancy  is interconnected with emotional responses and personal beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The Informed Choice Project provided an opportunity to increase  self-efficacy and confidence for more than a dozen health care professionals and  students while engaging in vaccine-related conversations on social media. To  enhance both participant satisfaction and compliance, future interventions  should consider using a self-paced format, flexible hours, and highlight the  vitality of health care professionals as key advocates for trusted sources of  information for the public.  © Caitlin Ford, Hinna Hasan, Madison Fullerton, Janette Wong, Margaret Pateman,  Hao Ming Chen, Theresa Tang, Jia Hu, Kirsten Cornelson.

The advancement of mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies has gained significant  momentum, particularly after the success of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19  pandemic and the recognition of mRNA vaccine development with the 2023 Nobel  Prize. mRNA encoding cytokines, antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T  cells has demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential in both preclinical  models and clinical trials. Previous study identified vascular endothelial  growth factor B (VEGF-B) as a metabolic regulator that controls lipid synthesis  and maintains mitochondrial membrane integrity, essential for the survival of  activated T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that mRNA encoding VEGF-B,  delivered to tumors via lipid nanoparticles, effectively controls tumor growth  in both subcutaneous and lung metastasis tumor models. Combination with  programmed death-1 blockade significantly amplified therapeutic efficacy,  leading to complete tumor regression in the lung metastasis model. Immune  profiling revealed that nanoparticle delivery of VEGF-B mRNA reprograms the  tumor microenvironment by increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhancing the  expression of effector molecules, including interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor  alpha, and granzyme B, while downregulating the exhaustion molecule programmed  death-1. These findings highlight the considerable promise of mRNA-based  therapies in reshaping the tumor microenvironment and enhancing cancer  immunotherapy outcomes.  © 2025 The Authors.

Post-treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD) is a poorly understood complication of  Borrelia burgdorferi infection with significant patient morbidity. Characterized  by fatigue, generalized myalgias, and cognitive impairment, PTLD symptomatology  closely resembles long COVID and other post-acute infection syndromes. While  prior studies suggest immune dysregulation as a factor in PTLD pathogenesis, the  mechanisms underlying its heterogeneous presentation and severity remain  unclear. To associate symptom burden with discrete immune phenotypes, we applied  factor analysis to self-reported symptom data from 272 PTLD patients to generate  patient subgroups. We then immunophenotyped peripheral blood cells of these  individuals and 28 healthy controls through 19-parameter flow cytometry and  cytokine profiling to associate PTLD status and the newly defined subgroups with  specific immune states. Our PTLD cohort had fewer circulating CXCR5+ CD4+ naïve  T cells relative to healthy controls (5.2% vs. 8.3%, Padj < 0.001). These cells  were positively associated with musculoskeletal pain in PTLD participants, but  not healthy controls. This and additional immunophenotypic alterations,  including an increased prevalence of CXCR3+ CCR4- CCR6- CD8 T cells (43.1% vs.  25.7%, Padj < 0.01), permitted the creation of an elastic net classifier which  identified PTLD with moderate efficacy (AUC 0.83). Measurement of cytokines did  not reveal associations with PTLD and did not improve the performance of the  model. While we could not identify immune features which distinguished all  patient subgroups, we did observe a female-specific increase in central memory  CD8 T cells restricted to one high-fatigue patient subgroup. Additionally,  factor analysis revealed multiple associations between immune cell frequency and  the severity of specific symptoms. Collectively, our findings add to growing  evidence of immune dysfunction as a prominent feature of PTLD.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) monovalent XBB.1.5 variant vaccine for reducing  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality among people aged 65 years or  older. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study; analysis of linked 2021  Australian census, Australian Immunisation Register, and death registrations  data. SETTING: Australia, 1 August 2023 to 29 February 2024; dominant SARS-CoV-2  Omicron subvariants: XBB-related until early December 2023, then the  BA.2.86-related JN.1. PARTICIPANTS: People aged 65 years or older on 1 August 2023. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative vaccine effectiveness by time since most recent  booster and booster type (XBB.1.5 variant or other), adjusted for age, gender,  state/territory, household income, number of medical conditions, number of  general practice visits, and influenza vaccination during 2022. RESULTS: By 29 February 2024, 1620 COVID-19-specific deaths among 4.12 million  people aged 65 years or older had been recorded. COVID-19 mortality was lower  among people who had received XBB.1.5 COVID-19 booster doses during the  preceding 90 days (21 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 9-52] per 100 000  person-years) than among those whose most recent booster had been more than 365  days ago (72 [95% CI, 61-84] per 100 000 person-years). The relative vaccine  effectiveness for XBB.1.5 boosters during the preceding 90 days (v any booster  > 365 days) was 74.7% (95% CI, 59.9-84.1%); for other booster types it was 51.6%  (95% CI, 39.3-61.4%). Relative vaccine effectiveness declined with time: for any  booster during the preceding 91-180 days (v any booster > 365 days) it was 31.2%  (95% CI, 18.9-41.6%); for any booster during the preceding 181-365 days it was  13.1% (95% CI, 1.8-23.2%). Relative XBB.1.5 vaccine effectiveness was similar in  analyses restricted to 1 December 2023 - 29 February 2024, when the dominant  Omicron subvariant was JN.1. CONCLUSIONS: Recent booster vaccination with the XBB.1.5 monovalent COVID-19  vaccine was highly effective for preventing COVID-19 deaths among people aged 65  years or older, including during the period in which the JN.1 was the dominant  SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant. Our findings provide support for the  recommendation that people aged 65 years or older receive COVID-19 vaccine  booster doses every six months.  © 2025 The Author(s).

Cancer vaccines are emerging as promising therapies to not only prevent cancer  but to treat cancer. Here, we developed a therapeutic vaccine for multiple  myeloma (MM) using BCMA protein as a target. Given the remarkable efficacy of  COVID 19 mRNA vaccines, we first packaged sequence- and base- optimized BCMA  mRNA into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) using next-generation ionizable lipid  enhancing their accumulation in the spleen. A TLR3 agonist,  polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), was also encapsulated in LNPs to  further elicit BCMA-specific immune response. BCMA-mRNA LNPs were internalized  by dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro, triggering proliferation and activation of  BCMA-specific CD8+ cytolytic T cells (CTLs). Importantly, these CTLs lysed BCMA+  U266 MM cells and CD138+ patient MM cells, without affecting BCMA-knockout (KO)  U266 or CD138- patient derived bone marrow cells. Vaccination of C57BL/6J mice  with BCMA-mRNA LNPs activated splenic DCs and induced BCMA-specific CTLs,  assessed by tetramer staining, which selectively killed murine 5TGM1 BCMA  overexpressing (5TGM1-BCMA-OE) MM cells. Finally, vaccination of  C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice bearing BCMA-overexpressing 5TGM1 cells inhibited tumor  growth associated with BCMA-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The combination  treatment with Poly(I:C) further triggered the immune response induced by  BCMA-mRNA LNPs in all instances. Our findings provide the framework for clinical  evaluation of BCMA-mRNA LNP vaccines to improve patient outcome in MM.  Copyright © 2025 American Society of Hematology.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity  and lost workdays in both military and non-military populations. To better  understand these infections and their outcomes, the Infectious Diseases Clinical  Research Program has enabled nine major ARI clinical research protocols in the  last decade, including observational studies and trials, spanning emerging and  reemerging ARI threats including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  2, influenza, adenovirus, entero/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory  syncytial virus, and other pathogens. These protocols have resulted in  epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and biospecimens from over 26,000  participants, most of whom were beneficiaries of a geographically distributed  Military Health System. METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Repository Protocol establishes a  unique Department of Defense (DoD) research resource through the pooling of data  and specimens from nine ARI protocols into a master, standardized database with  a linked specimen repository. This will enable further targeted scientific  questions in participant-level pooled meta-analyses and will serve as an  on-demand repository for rapid assay development, sample size estimations for  prospective studies, and observational study/clinical trial design (including as  part of future rapid pandemic research response). Accordingly, the objectives  and study design of this protocol are broad. This protocol will allow analyses  on outcomes including: (i) short-term ARI outcomes such as hospitalization, work  days lost, symptom severity and duration; (ii) post-acute ARI outcomes,  including persistence of symptoms, return-to-health, post-ARI medical  encounters; (iii) vaccine effectiveness for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  influenza, and adenovirus vaccines; (iv) ARI infection and vaccination elicited  immune responses (humoral, T-cell, other); (v) therapeutic effectiveness of  COVID-19 and influenza antivirals (acute symptoms, hospitalization, post-acute  sequelae); (vi) effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,  masking) against infection; (vii) prognostic and mechanistic host viral  biomarkers which correlate with the above outcomes; (viii) ARI diagnostic assay  validity and performance. This repository protocol is inherently broad in scope;  the collation of standardized data and phenotype-linked specimens is a  fundamental, primary objective. DISCUSSION: This protocol will support statistical and laboratory analyses,  including activities related to rapid epidemic response such as assay  development and rapid sample size calculations for clinical trials. A series of  more specific scientific questions from current and future collaborators will  leverage this joint database and specimen repository; these questions will  target important aspects of ARI infection, transmission, outcomes, and  treatment. Future protocols (and ongoing data from existing IDCRP protocols)  will be added to this collaborative repository protocol.

Vaccine hesitancy, particularly among racialized communities, persists due to  misinformation, medical mistrust, and systemic barriers. This study examines  racial disparities and key determinants related to perceptions of COVID-19  vaccine effectiveness in Canadian parents from Arab, Asian, Black, Indigenous,  White and mixed-race communities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a  representative sample of 2,528 Canadian parents of children aged 0-12 years  (57.5% women). Participants completed a survey assessing conspiracy beliefs,  health literacy, major experiences of racial discrimination, and perceptions of  COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. The mean COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness  perception score was 19.57 (SD = 5.32). ANOVA showed significant differences by  race (F = 5.15, p < .001), with Asian (M = 21.41, SD = 4.12) and Indigenous  parents (M = 21.42, SD = 4.85) reporting higher scores than White, Black, and  Arab ones. Regression analyses indicated that conspiracy beliefs negatively  predicted vaccine effectiveness perception (β = -0.05, p < .001), while health  literacy had a positive association (β = .19, p < .001). Major racial  discrimination was negatively associated but became non-significant after  adjusting for conspiracy beliefs. Vaccine effectiveness perception varies across  racial groups. Higher health literacy and prior vaccination enhance perceptions,  while conspiracy beliefs undermine them. Addressing misinformation and tailoring  public health strategies to diverse parental experiences - particularly among  younger parents and marginalized groups - will strengthen vaccine confidence.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is  well established; however, the long-term durability of vaccine-induced immunity  remains to be fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: This study longitudinally compared humoral and cellular immune  responses in two groups: G1, who received two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac, and  G2, who received two doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford, both subsequently boosted with  Pfizer. METHODS: Immune responses were assessed at five time points: P1 (prior to the  second dose), P2 (90-180 days after the second dose), P3 (pre-booster, six-eight  months post-second dose), P4 (90-180 days post-booster), and P5 (180-270 days  post-booster). Anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) IgG levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA), while IFNγ-producing cells in response to Spike peptides were  quantified using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT). IgG subclasses  were analysed in a subset of samples. RESULTS: Following the first dose, Sinovac-CoronaVac induced lower anti-Spike  IgG levels than AstraZeneca-Oxford, though levels equalised after the second  dose. After the Pfizer booster, anti-Spike IgG levels remained elevated for up  to six months in both groups. IgG1 was predominant in both groups, with  occasional expression of IgG2 and IgG4. The mean frequency of IFNγ-producing  cells was lower in the Sinovac-CoronaVac group before and up to six months after  the second dose, compared to AstraZeneca-Oxford. However, post-Pfizer booster,  both means became comparable. Between 90-180 days post-booster, the  Sinovac-CoronaVac + Pfizer group exhibited a statistically significant decline  in IFNγ-producing cells relative to the AstraZeneca-Oxford + Pfizer group. By  P5, over half of individuals in the Sinovac-CoronaVac + Pfizer group  demonstrated no detectable cellular response. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: High antibody levels were maintained for up to six months  following both homologous and heterologous vaccination. However, cellular  immunity declined more markedly in the Sinovac-CoronaVac + Pfizer group,  resulting in a higher proportion of non-responders. These findings underscore  the importance of tailored booster strategies to sustain protective immunity  against COVID-19.

While disparities in COVID-19 vaccine confidence, mistrust, hesitancy, and  uptake are well documented, the perception of vaccine efficacy remains  understudied in Canada. This study investigates racial differences in COVID-19  vaccine efficacy perception and examines associated factors across Arab, Asian,  Black, Indigenous, and White populations. A representative sample of 4220  participants (2358 women) aged 16 and older completed measures assessing  perception of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, conspiracy beliefs, health literacy,  and racial discrimination in healthcare settings. Data were collected through a  randomly selected online panel in October 2023. The overall mean vaccine  efficacy perception score was 17.1 (SD = 4.5), with significant variation across  racial groups (F(6, 4213) = 8.0, p < .001). Asian participants (M = 18.4;  SD = 3.1) reported higher scores compared to Arab (M = 17.0; SD = 4.3), Black  (M = 17.2; SD = 4.3), Indigenous (M = 16.4; SD = 5.2), and White (M = 17.1;  SD = 4.4) participants. The most important factors associated with vaccine  efficacy perception were conspiracy beliefs (β = -0.32, p < .001), health  literacy (β = 0.07, p < .001), and the number of vaccine doses in White  individuals. Conspiracy beliefs (β = -0.19, p < .001), higher education  (β = 0.28, p < .001), health literacy (β = 0.16, p < .001), more vaccine doses  (β = 1.61, p < .001), and experiences of racial discrimination in healthcare  prior to accounting for conspiracy beliefs (β = -0.10, p < .05) were the most  important factors for racialized individuals. This study highlights significant  differences in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy perceptions across racial groups. The  findings underscore the impact of factors such as conspiracy beliefs, health  literacy, education level, age, and racial discrimination in healthcare on  vaccine efficacy perceptions. Public health strategies should address  misinformation, prioritize health literacy, and promote anti-racist practices in  healthcare to improve vaccine confidence and acceptance.  Copyright © 2024.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may  suppress coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine responses in people with  multiple sclerosis (pwMS), limited data are available on the cumulative effect  of additional boosters. Maturation of Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) to target a  greater diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially past the BA.1 variant, has  not been reported. In addition, the prediction of variant-specific protection,  given that Spike antibody testing is not performed routinely, remains a  challenge. We, therefore, evaluated whether additional vaccine doses improved  the breadth of cross-variant recognition to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.  Machine learning-based models were designed to predict variant-specific  protection status. METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort (n = 442), Spike IgG titers and  live virus neutralization against D614, BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, XBB.1.1, XBB.1.5, and  EG.5.1 variants were determined in 1,011 serum samples (0-12 months after 2-4  doses). Predictive protection models were developed by K-fold cross-validation  on training and test data sets (random split 70:30). RESULTS: After primary vaccination, pwMS on immunosuppressive disease-modifying  therapy (IMM-DMT) had 10-fold and 7.2-fold lower D614 Spike IgG titers than pwMS  on low-efficacy (LE)-DMT and cladribine (p < 0.01). After 4 doses, pwMS on  IMM-DMT had significantly lower Spike IgG titers, compared with pwMS on  low-efficacy disease-modifying therapy, for D614 (p < 0.05), as well as BA.1,  BA.2, BA.5, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, and EG.5.1(p < 0.01). The breadth of Spike IgG to  recognize variants other than the cognate antigen increased after 4 doses of all  DMTs. Although pwMS on IMM-DMT displayed reduced cross-variant recognition, a  fourth dose resulted in a 2-4-fold increase in protection against newer variants  and a reduction in two-thirds of pwMS without protective Spike IgG (p < 0.0001).  Tixagevimab and cilgavimab did not induce additional cross-variant protection.  Variant-specific predictive models of vaccine protection were influenced by  treatment, time since primary vaccination, and age, with high sensitivity  (99.4%, 95% CI 96.8-99.99) and specificity (72.0%, 95% CI 50.6-87.9) for  XBB.1.5/EG.5.1 variants. DISCUSSION: Despite not eliciting adequate antibody response in pwMS on IMM-DMT,  COVID-19 boosters improve the breadth of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2  emerging variants. Vaccine protection can be predicted by statistical modeling.  DOI: 10.1212/NXI.0000000000200443 PMCID: PMC12285670 PMID: 40694731 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most clinically advanced delivery platforms  for mRNA therapeutics; however, their full potential is significantly limited by  suboptimal intracellular mRNA delivery. Herein, we report the rational chemical  design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct  an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA  delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated  uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic  covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This  chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery,  effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional  LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold  increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard  LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA  expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses  elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response.  Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of  conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential. These  findings establish that SLNP, by leveraging the chemically innovative  thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, offers a promising and chemically distinct  strategy to enhance both the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, which is  particularly valuable in scenarios of limited vaccine supply and for minimizing  potential adverse effects associated with high vaccine dosages.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of the Sinopharm coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, introduced in Mozambique, against the Omicron variant  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), prevalent from  March 2022 to December 2023. METHODS: A test-negative case-control study was nested in a community-based  enhanced COVID-19 surveillance in seven healthcare facilities including mobile  testing stations in the Dondo District, Mozambique, between March 2022 and  December 2023. Participants were individuals aged ≥2 years with COVID-19-like  symptoms for <10 days. Cases were those with polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19. For each case, three PCR test-negative controls were  matched, according to age (±5 years), sex, and date of PCR test (±7 days).  Follow-up for all cases was conducted until disease resolution. Vaccine  protection was assessed according to the association between complete  vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 disease onset ≥14 days after vaccination. RESULTS: The study did not reach the targeted sample size, and only a third were  analyzed. A total of 253 cases were matched to 759 test-negative controls by  age, sex, and testing date, a process known as matching. Among cases, 41% had  one dose of Sinopharm, 53% had two doses, and 6% were unvaccinated. Among the  test-negative controls, 37% had 1 dose, 57% had two doses, and 7% were  unvaccinated. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness, calculated using matching and  adjusted for age and PCR test date, was 18.0% (95% confidence interval, -85.3 to  63.7; P = .63). No COVID-19-positive participants required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In an Omicron-dominant setting, two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine  did not show significant protection against symptomatic COVID-19. However, as  our analysis was based on data from only a third of enrolled individuals with  confirmed vaccination status, these findings should be interpreted with caution.  Our results underscore the importance of real-time vaccine effectiveness  evaluations to inform optimal rollout strategies in low- and middle-income  countries.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  This study is interested in global vaccine confidence because it directly  impacts vaccination rates and public health outcomes, especially during the  COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, due to the unique vulnerabilities to  vaccine-preventable diseases, misinformation, and access to health information  among adults aged 65 and older, understanding vaccine confidence in this  population is crucial for developing targeted interventions and improving  vaccination rates. The current research is limited by single-country surveys and  cross-sectional designs, providing limited insights into these issues. We  compared the vaccine confidence between the population over 65 and under 65 in  terms of vaccine safety, effectiveness, compatibility with religious beliefs,  and importance to children. We employed a hierarchical logistic model, and  compared human development index (HDI) values to investigate determinants of  vaccine confidence. Vaccine confidence increased between 2015 and 2019, but  decreased between 2019 and 2022 across most global regions, exhibiting an  inverted U-shaped trend. Population over 65 in high-income countries was more  likely to agree on the safety, effectiveness, importance to children, and  compatibility of vaccines with religious beliefs than those under 65, with  agreement levels exceeding 80% for most aspects. Gender, education, income, and  religion influenced vaccine attitudes among adults aged 65 and older. Countries  with an HDI exceeding 0.9 consistently demonstrated positive trends in vaccine  confidence. This relationship between HDI and vaccine confidence underscores the  importance of comprehensive societal development in shaping attitudes toward  vaccination. These findings can help develop targeted interventions and policies  to improve vaccination rates among older adults.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a public health concern  even after its pandemic status officially ended on May 5, 2023, when XBB became  the globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant. Amid population immunity, the  benefit of the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines remains uncertain. METHODS: This systematic review searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through November 30, 2024, for  studies evaluating the effectiveness of XBB.1.5 vaccines in adults during the  2023-2024 season. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model  (PROSPERO registration: CRD42024513730). RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible studies, with a total of 53,396,781 participants,  were included. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the first month post-vaccination  was 52.9 % (95 % CI: 47.6 %-57.6 %) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 64.4 % (95 %  CI: 59.3 %-68.9 %) against COVID-19-related hospitalization, and 77.3 % (95 %  CI: 67.1 %-84.3 %) against COVID-19-related death. However, by the fifth month,  VE declined to 26.7 %, 52.3 %, and 69.4 %, respectively. Notably, against the  JN.1 variant that replaced XBB in December 2023, VE against infection,  hospitalization, and death dropped significantly by 47 % (from 53.7 % to  28.3 %), 32 % (from 67.8 % to 46.2 %), and 26 % (from 77.3 % to 57.1 %),  respectively. VE against hospitalization in individuals aged >60 years was not  inferior to that in those aged <60 years (57.2 % versus 49.2 %; subgroup  difference, p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: XBB.1.5 vaccines provided substantial protection against severe  COVID-19 outcomes in the 2023-2024 season prior to the emergence of the JN.1  variant. These findings underscore the need for updated COVID-19 vaccinations to  maintain protection against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.  Copyright © 2025. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the ongoing arms race between mutating  viruses and human antibodies has revealed several novel strategies by which  antibodies adapt to viral escape. While SARS-CoV-2 viruses exhibit high  variability in epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, certain epitopes  remain conserved owing to their essential roles on viral fitness. Antibodies can  acquire broadly neutralizing activity by targeting these vulnerable sites  through affinity-based somatic evolution of immunoglobulin genes. Notably, the  specificity encoded in antibody germline genes also plays a fundamental role in  acquiring the breadth. In-depth genetic and structural analyses of the antibody  repertoires have uncovered multiple strategies for adapting to evolving targets.  The integration of large-scale antibody datasets with computational approaches  increases the feasibility and efficiency of designing broadly neutralizing  antibody therapeutics from ancestral antibody clones with limited initial  efficacy. In this review, we discuss strategies to optimize antibody breadth for  the development of broadly neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccine  antigens.

Analyzing greedy vaccine allocation algorithms for metapopulation disease  models.  Keithley J(1), Choudhuri A(1), Adhikari B(1), Pemmaraju SV(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Computer Science, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United  States of America.  As observed in the case of COVID-19, effective vaccines for an emerging pandemic  tend to be in limited supply initially and must be allocated strategically. The  allocation of vaccines can be modeled as a discrete optimization problem that  prior research has shown to be computationally difficult (i.e., NP-hard) to  solve even approximately. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental  results, we show that this hardness result may be circumvented. We present our  results in the context of a metapopulation model, which views a population as  composed of geographically dispersed heterogeneous subpopulations, with  arbitrary travel patterns between them. In this setting, vaccine bundles are  allocated at a subpopulation level, and so the vaccine allocation problem can be  formulated as a problem of maximizing an integer lattice function [Formula: see  text] subject to a budget constraint [Formula: see text]. We consider a variety  of simple, well-known greedy algorithms for this problem and show the  effectiveness of these algorithms for three problem instances at different  scales: New Hampshire (10 counties, population 1.4 million), Iowa (99 counties,  population 3.2 million), and Texas (254 counties, population 30.03 million). We  provide a theoretical explanation for this effectiveness by showing that the  approximation factor (a measure of how well the algorithmic output for a problem  instance compares to its theoretical optimum) of these algorithms depends on the  submodularity ratio of the objective function g. The submodularity ratio of a  function is a measure of how distant g is from being submodular; here  submodularity refers to the very useful ""diminishing returns"" property of set  and lattice functions, i.e., the property that as the function inputs are  increased the function value increases, but not by as much.

Comparative Analysis of Preferences and Willingness to Pay for COVID-19 Vaccine  Among Individuals With and Without Chronic Diseases: A Discrete Choice  Experiment Approach.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines  have been pivotal in the global battle against the pandemic. However, vaccine  acceptance remains a critical determinant of their effectiveness. While numerous  studies have explored factors influencing vaccine acceptance, there is a notable  dearth of research regarding preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) among  individuals with chronic diseases (ChD) who are at heightened risk of severe  COVID-19 outcomes. This study addresses this gap by investigating COVID-19  vaccine preferences and WTP among individuals with and without chronic diseases. METHODS: Employing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach, we interviewed  843 participants to assess their preference for COVID-19 vaccine attributes such  as origin, efficacy level, protection duration, and provider. We used a mixed  logit model to analyze DCE data and estimated WTP by taking the negative ratio  of preference and price parameters. Furthermore, we performed a stratified  analysis according to the household head's ChD status. RESULTS: As expected, vaccines with higher efficacy and longer protection are  most preferred. Interestingly, our research shows a preference for European and  American vaccines over Chinese vaccines. Additionally, this study reveals a  preference for private facilities over government facilities for vaccinations  among vaccine seekers. Patients with ChD exhibit higher WTP than those without  such conditions, demonstrating the group's urgency in becoming vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Vaccine procurement and administration decisions by health  authorities should be evidence-based and reflect public preferences regarding  acceptance and WTP. Health authorities should prioritize both high efficacy and  long-lasting protection in vaccine procurement, ensuring that neither is  compromised. This approach addresses the top concerns of both groups-vaccine  effectiveness for the ChD group and extended immunity for the NChD group. This  study also informs policy decisions regarding vaccine origin and suggests  incorporating private facilities as vaccine administration points to reduce  pressure on government facilities.  © 2025 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  The emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has significantly compromised the  effectiveness of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines. We investigated a  prime-boost approach using bovine adenoviral (Ad) [BAd] and human Ad (HAd)  vectors expressing the spike (S), membrane (M), or nucleocapsid (N) with the  autophagy-inducing peptide C5 (AIP-C5) for enhanced antigen-specific immunity.  The combinational vaccine formulation expressing three antigens demonstrated  markedly elevated antigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses compared  to groups immunized with vectors expressing individual antigens. Furthermore,  vaccinated animals exhibited 100% survival, significant reductions in lung viral  titers, and no apparent signs of morbidity following challenges with Delta or  Omicron variants in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Surprisingly, immunization with  vectors expressing M and N resulted in immune suppression. However, including S  with M and N overcomes this antagonistic interaction and significantly enhances  immune responses and protection efficacy. Using the BAd vaccine platform in a  multi-antigen approach complemented with AIP-C5 is a promising strategy for  developing next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.  © 2025. The Author(s).

OBJECTIVES: In February 2022, NVX-CoV2373 became available in South Korea;  real-world effectiveness of multiple doses compared with mRNA-based vaccines has  not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: This retrospective study identified NVX-CoV2373 and BNT162b2 recipients  aged ≥12 years from the K-COV-N database. Vaccine groups were propensity  score-matched based on demographic characteristics, Seoul capital area  residence, income level, comorbidity/disability, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and  prior vaccination dose/timing. Outcomes were any and severe (intensive-care-unit  admission or death within 8 weeks of infection) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2  infection assessed from 7 days after the third and fourth dose. Adjusted hazard  ratios (aHRs) from matched groups measured vaccine effectiveness up to a 180-day  risk window. RESULTS: From February to December 2022, 923,833 NVX-CoV2373 and 1,286,604  BNT162b2 doses were administered. The 180-day risk-window aHRs (95% CI) for  NVX-CoV2373 compared with BNT162b2 for any SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.78  (0.76-0.79) post third dose and 0.86 (0.86-0.87) post fourth dose. The 180-day  aHRs (95% CI) for severe infection were 0.73 (0.53-1.00) after the third dose  and 1.21 (1.03-1.42) after the fourth dose. CONCLUSIONS: NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated favorable and similar effectiveness  against any and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively, compared with  BNT162b2, with evidence of enhanced NVX-CoV2373 durability.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated vaccine development and generated a rapidly  evolving body of evidence before and after the vaccine rollout. We developed a  robust online platform to efficiently synthesize this emerging information for  current and future challenges. Expanding upon our interactive living systematic  review-initially focused on COVID-19- we now include chikungunya and Lassa fever  (with protocols presented in this issue), Mpox, and Disease X (  https://www.safeinpregnancy.org ). We aim to continuously monitor and  periodically update and disseminate high-quality data on vaccine safety,  efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity in pregnancy and childhood. This  platform computes real-time meta-analyses and features a visualization tool to  present findings in a clear and accessible manner, supporting decision-making,  vaccine development pipelines, and implementation strategies worldwide. It is  also designed to integrate data on a hub of emerging vaccines in pregnancy and  childhood and reflects a collaborative effort among multiple organizations.  © 2025. The Author(s).

(2)Analytical Research & Development, USA. (3)Vaccine Drug Product Development, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.  Adjuvants play important roles in vaccine immunogenicity, potency, and clinical  efficacy. Recently, nanoparticle-based adjuvants have garnered significant  attention due to their unique properties, mechanisms of action and successes in  vaccines against COVID-19. Understanding the size and charge of these  nanoparticles can help predict and control their behavior in biological systems.  Conventionally, the size and charge of nanoparticles are measured using dynamic  light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) in batch mode.  Herein, we report an electrical asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation  (EAF4) method for the multi-attribute characterization of lipid nanoparticle  (LNP) and nanoemulsion (NE). The EAF4 was coupled with UV, multi-angle light  scattering (MALS), DLS, electrophoretic mobility (e-mobility) and refractive  index (RI) detections to measure the molecular weight (MW), hydrodynamic radius  (Rh) and zeta potential (ζ) of the nanoparticles. This EAF4-UV-MALS(DLS)-RI  method allows for peak-targeted analysis of size and charge properties.  Nanoparticle attributes are analyzed by EAF4 method in a more specific manner  than by batch DLS/ELS.  Copyright © 2025. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Zambia's 2024 Measles-Rubella Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA),  conducted from 23 to 28 September across all 116 districts, targeted children  aged 9-59 months to address immunization gaps exacerbated by COVID-19  disruptions and responding to ongoing measles outbreaks. This community case  study evaluates the effectiveness of microplanning, the feasibility of real-time  digital monitoring, and the equity of reaching zero-dose children during  Zambia's 2024 Measles-Rubella SIA, using a mixed-method approach to inform  scalable immunization strategies in resource-limited settings. Through  comprehensive microplanning, strategic community engagement, and real-time  digital monitoring, the campaign achieved 97% national coverage and reached  165,000 previously zero-dose children in underserved communities. Implementation  utilized Google Sheets and Open Data Kit tools, with quality assurance through  over 7,500 supervisory visits. Despite achieving high overall coverage, several  challenges emerged: funding delays, logistical constraints in remote areas, and  data quality issues. Key lessons include the necessity of timely funding  disbursement, strengthened cold chain infrastructure, and rigorous data  verification processes. Community involvement through local leadership  engagement and radio campaigns proved essential to success, while digital  monitoring enabled rapid adaptation to emerging challenges. This case study  provides actionable insights for designing equitable immunization campaigns in  resource-limited settings, supporting global measles and rubella elimination  goals through evidence of effectively tailored, data-driven strategies.

Objective: To explore the progress and trend in research of target trial  emulation (TTE) and provide reference for research in this field. Methods: A  literature retrival of research papers in this field published as of November  30, 2024 was conducted based on three databases (i.e. PubMed, Web of Science,  and Scopus). The papers which were highly cited were analyzed by Bibliometrix  package in R 4.3.2. The co-occurrence network of keywords were analyzed by using  software VOSviewer. The keyword burst test was carried out with software  CiteSpace. Results: A total of 685 papers from 314 journals were included. The  annual number of the papers published showed a significant growth in recent  three years. JAMA Network Open had the highest publication mumber related to TTE  (34 papers), Annals of Internal Medicine had the highest H-index and American  Journal of Epidemiology had the highest total citations. In the 2 997 authors,  Hernán MA made a greatest contribution. In the 2 046 institutions, Harvard  Medical School was at leading position. The analysis on highly cited papers and  keyword co-occurrence showed that TTE was mainly used in the studies of COVID-19  vaccine, cancer and the treatment efficacy and safety of chronic diseases. The  analysis on the co-occurence of keyword burst test showed that keywords  frequently used until 2024 were COVID-19 vaccine, cardiovascular disease and  breast cancer. Conclusions: TTE is mainly used in the studies of public health  emergency (such as COVID-19), patients with cancer and chronic diseases. TTE  will play a crucial role when randomized controlled trial is difficult to  conduct or current evidence requirement can not be met.

BACKGROUND: Obeldesivir is an oral nucleoside analogue prodrug antiviral that  inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and  tolerability of obeldesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalised  individuals at low risk of progression to severe disease. METHODS: OAKTREE was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial in 107 centres (including research centres, primary care centres, and  hospitals) in Japan and the USA. Low-risk, non-hospitalised adults and  adolescents with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were enrolled within 3 days of  symptom onset. Eligible participants were randomly assigned 1:1 using permuted  block randomisation (block size of four), stratified by historical completion of  a primary COVID-19 vaccination series, to receive either oral obeldesivir 350 mg  or matched placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was  time to COVID-19 symptom alleviation by day 29, which was assessed in all  randomly assigned participants who received one or more doses of study drug, had  positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (per central laboratory testing) at baseline, and had  COVID-19 symptom data (full analysis positive set). The primary safety endpoint  was the incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities and was  assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received one or more doses of  study drug. As a secondary endpoint we assessed change from baseline in nasal  swab viral RNA copy number at day 5 in all randomly assigned participants who  received one or more doses of study drug and had a quantifiable baseline value.  This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05715528, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2023 and Oct 31, 2023, 1955 participants (1155 female  and 800 male; 1698 White, 207 Black, 42 Asian, and eight Other) were randomly  assigned and received at least one dose of either obeldesivir (n=979) or placebo  (n=976). Overall, 1368 (70·0%) participants had completed a primary COVID-19  vaccination series and 1938 (99·6%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.  There were 884 participants in each group in the full analysis positive set.  Among those in the full analysis positive set who completed the symptom  questionnaire (ie, who had COVID-19 symptom data; 879 obeldesivir, 882 placebo),  median time to COVID-19 symptom alleviation was 5·9 days (95% CI 5·4-6·1) in the  obeldesivir group and 6·0 days (5·8-6·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio  1·099 [95% CI 0·997-1·211], p=0·068). The least-squares mean change from  baseline in viral RNA copy number at day 5 was -2·13 log10 copies per mL (SE  0·04) and -1·95 log10 copies per mL (0·04) for the obeldesivir group (n=637) and  placebo group (n=622), respectively, with a least-squares mean difference of  -0·18 (95% CI -0·30 to -0·06) log10 copies per mL (p=0·0037). The safety profile  was comparable between groups. 53 (5·4%) of 979 participants in the obeldesivir  group and 56 (5·7%) of 976 participants in the placebo group had one or more  treatment-emergent adverse events. 753 (77·5%) participants in the obeldesivir  group and 757 (78·5%) participants in the placebo group had one or more graded  laboratory abnormalities, most of which were grade 1 or 2. INTERPRETATION: Obeldesivir was generally safe and well tolerated, with greater  reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copy number versus placebo at day 5. However,  obeldesivir did not significantly reduce time to symptom alleviation, possibly  reflecting the challenges of assessing efficacy in this population in an era of  high rates of vaccine-induced and natural immunity.

AIM: To estimate the influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against absenteeism  among healthcare personnel (HCP) during the 2022-2023 season. METHODS: We prospectively followed 5752 HCP employed in four tertiary-care  hospitals in Greece from November 14, 2022 to May 28, 2023 for episodes of  absenteeism. Upon onset of symptoms, HCP were tested for influenza and  SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen detection test. RESULTS: A total of 1029 episodes of absenteeism occurred during the study  period. Influenza accounted for 95 (9.2 %) of episodes. The mean duration of  work absence per influenza-related episode of absenteeism was 3.6 days compared  to a mean of 5.4 days per other non-influenza-related episode of absenteeism  (p-value <0.001). Influenza accounted for 341 days missed out of a total of  5360 days missed during the study period. Overall, 1332 HCP had received an  influenza vaccine for the 2022-2023 season (influenza vaccination rate: 23.1 %).  The unadjusted IVE estimate against influenza-related absenteeism among all HCP  was 48.9 % [95 % confidence intervals (CIs): 6.1 % to 71.1 %; p-value = 0.03].  After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, profession, influenza  vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination, and hospital-level variation, the adjusted  IVE among HCP with absenteeism was estimated at 69.9 % (95 % CIs, 39.3 % to  85.1 %, p-value = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza remains a significant cause of morbidity and absenteeism  among HCP in the post-COVID era. Vaccination conferred significant protection  against influenza-associated absenteeism among HCP during the 2022-2023 season.  HCP should be up to date with influenza vaccination to protect them as well as  healthcare facilities from HCP absenteeism.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hesitancy Toward the First COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose: A Cross-Sectional  Study in Morocco.  Chellat FZ(1), Bahra N(1), Marsou Z(1), El Baldi M(1), Benmaamar S(1), Tachfouti  N(1), Otmani N(1), Berraho M(1), El Rhazi K(1).  Author information: (1)Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah University, Fez, Morocco.  BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant global health  challenges, requiring mass vaccination to reduce severe illness and mortality.  Despite strong evidence supporting booster dose safety and efficacy, uptake  remains low due to widespread hesitancy. This study aims to comprehensively  explore the factors contributing to first COVID-19 booster vaccine hesitancy  among the general population in Morocco. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 574 participants from  primary healthcare centers in Fez, Morocco, between April 2022 and April 2023.  Data were collected using a structured questionnaire based on the WHO SAGE  framework, assessing socio-demographic, contextual, individual, group, and  vaccine-specific determinants. Statistical analyses included chi-squared tests  and multivariate logistic regression (P < .05). RESULTS: Hesitancy toward the first booster dose was reported by 66.2% of  participants. Vaccine-specific concerns were the strongest predictor (Adjusted  Odds Ratio [AOR] = 27.6; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = [11.1-68.3]; P < .001),  followed by contextual factors (AOR = 7.8; 95% CI = [4.0-15.4]; P < .001) and  individual/group determinants (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI = [1.6-5.6]; P = .001). Younger  age (<46 years, AOR = 3.0) and lower income (AOR = 5.9) also increased  hesitancy. CONCLUSION: Booster dose hesitancy in Morocco is driven by vaccine-specific  concerns, contextual influences, and individual beliefs. Addressing these  factors through targeted communication, trust-building strategies, and inclusive  public health policies is essential to increase booster uptake and strengthen  national pandemic response efforts.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus behind  COVID-19, has a single-stranded RNA genome approximately 30 kb long. Due to its  continuous mutation and potential for reemergence, identifying new therapeutic  targets is crucial. G-quadruplexes (G4s), high-order genome structures, are  promising therapeutic targets for various viral diseases due to their ability to  inhibit virus replication. To develop new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs targeting G4s,  identifying G4 structures in the viral genome and finding small molecules that  selectively bind to them is essential. Recently, we identified a unique  G4-forming sequence (SC-2) in SARS-CoV-2 RNA using our developed G4 prediction  tool. We screened our in-house compound library with a Thiazole Orange (TO)  displacement assay and found bis-urea/bis-thiourea compounds that bind to the  SC-2 G4 motif. Notably, a bis-thiourea compound (BT1) inhibited SARS-CoV-2  replication in a VeroE6/TMPRSS2 infection assay, showing antiviral activity  comparable to remdesivir. The displacement efficacy of TO from G4 by synthesized  bis-urea/bis-thiourea derivatives to SC-2 G4 correlated strongly with reduced  viral RNA levels in infected cells. Fluorescently labeled bis-thiourea compounds  accumulated near double-stranded RNA during viral replication, highlighting  their potential to target viral RNA G4s. Our study offers a new approach for  anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.  DOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.5c00095 PMID: 40674354"

IMPORTANCE: Persons with cancer are at increased risk of severe COVID-19  infection, but the additional benefit of COVID-19 boosters is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and number needed to  vaccinate (NNV) among persons with cancer of an additional dose of the  monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study conducted in 4  health care systems in the US among persons with cancer receiving chemotherapy  or immunotherapy. Statistical analysis was conducted between March 2023 and  August 2024. EXPOSURES: Receipt of an additional dose of the monovalent COVID-19 vaccine  before January 1, 2022, with follow-up until August 31, 2022, and the bivalent  COVID-19 vaccine from September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19 hospitalization, diagnosed COVID-19, and  COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Among 72 831 persons with cancer (17 922 female individuals [24.6%]),  69% received a monovalent booster by January 1, 2022. During 34 006 person-years  of follow-up, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate was 30.5 per 1000 person-years  among patients who received a monovalent booster vs 41.9 per 1000 person-years  among patients who received the primary series alone, with an adjusted VE of  29.2% (95% CI, 19.9%-37.3%) and NNV to prevent 1 COVID-19 hospitalization of 166  (95% CI, 130-244). There was also significant VE to prevent diagnosed COVID-19  (8.5% [95% CI, 3.7%-13.0%]) and COVID-19-related ICU admission (35.6% [95% CI,  20.0%-48.3%]). Among 88 417 persons with cancer (24 589 female individuals  [27.8%]) with 81 027 person-years of follow-up during the bivalent period,  patients who received this booster (38%) had a COVID-19 hospitalization rate of  13.4 per 1000 person-years vs 21.7 per 1000 person-years among persons who did  not receive a bivalent vaccine, with an adjusted VE of 29.9% (95% CI,  19.4%-39.1%) and NNV to prevent 1 COVID-19 hospitalization of 451 (95% CI,  345-697); the adjusted VE was 30.1% (95% CI, 7.7%-47.0%) to prevent  COVID-19-related ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 booster  vaccinations were associated with significant protection against severe  COVID-19, with a favorable NNV among persons with cancer. However, uptake of  COVID-19 vaccine boosters was low, and interventions are therefore justified to  increase COVID-19 uptake in this high-risk population.

A cross-sectional study on  vaccine hesitancy in the post-COVID-19 era.  Wang X(#)(1), Wen S(#)(2), Wu J(1), Cui Z(1), Shen H(1), Hu S(1), Zeng S(1),  Tang Y(1).  Author information: (1)Xuhui District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China. (2)School of Journalism and Communication, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. (#)Contributed equally  OBJECTIVES: To investigate the determinants of influenza vaccine hesitancy (VH)  among older adults in Shanghai, China, using the 3Cs model (confidence,  complacency, and convenience) and vaccine literacy (VL) framework. This study  also explored the potential effect of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy on influenza  vaccine attitudes in the post-COVID-19 era. METHODS: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study from January to  June 2024 in Shanghai, China, involving 1,300 adults aged ≥60 years.  Participants were recruited through stratified random sampling. Inclusion  criteria were: community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 years in Xuhui District.  Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of  vaccine hesitancy, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, self-reported  health status and self-report vaccination experiences. Structural equation  modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the underlying factors contributing to  vaccine hesitancy and quantify their interrelationships. RESULTS: A high proportion (85.2%) of participants exhibited influenza vaccine  hesitancy, with 16.2% being complete refusers. Key predictors of hesitancy  included distrust in vaccine efficacy (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 2.28 for  refusal), low perceived influenza severity (aOR = 5.59 for refusal), and  overreliance on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (aOR = 3.37 for refusal)  and influenza-specific medication (aOR = 3.76). Limited health communication  with community health workers (CHWs) and low family support significantly  amplified refusal risks (aOR = 3.63). Higher vaccine knowledge reduced hesitancy  (aOR = 1.85), though paradoxically, higher critical vaccine literacy correlated  with refusal tendencies (aOR = 0.36). Significant standardized estimated  coefficient (β) were observed between confidence and complacency (β = 0.846),  side-effect experience and complacency (β = 0.293), side-effect experience and  depression (β = 0.294), convenience and depression (β = 0.293), and side-effect  experience and needle phobia (β = 0.362). CONCLUSION: Vaccine confidence deficits and complacency regarding influenza  severity are major drivers of hesitancy in older adults. This hesitancy is  further exacerbated by COVID-19 vaccine skepticism and nuanced aspects of  vaccine literacy. System-level interventions should integrate proactive vaccine  counseling into routine care, strengthen family engagement in immunization  decisions, and develop misinformation-resilient vaccine literacy programs  specifically tailored for this vulnerable population.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) documented an estimated decrease in life  expectancy of 1.6 years globally. Pregnant women exhibited higher infection  rates and experienced prolonged illness durations, often exceeding four months.  COVID-19 was also related to adverse maternal morbidity and near-miss incidents.  In India, although there are studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines  among the overall population, the effectiveness in preventing infections among  pregnant women is not well documented. The present meta-analysis pooled the  safety of the COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant women in India. The search was  conducted among the major electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,  and Cochrane (date of search: November 30, 2024). Screening, risk of bias (ROB),  and data extraction of the studies were undertaken by two independent reviewers,  with adjudication of conflicts by a third reviewer. We described the pooled  effectiveness of vaccination on adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and  fetomaternal outcomes using RStudio (Posit Software, Boston, MA). The I²  statistic assessed the heterogeneity among studies. We conducted a Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment to  ascertain the certainty of the results. Database search yielded 215 unique  articles. We included nine eligible studies for the analysis, including 5,630  pregnant women. Covishield and Covaxin were the vaccines taken by them. The  pooled odds ratio (OR) for preterm labor in mothers with COVID-19 vaccination  was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.79), with low certainty. The OR  for low birth weight was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.06-13.71). AEFI rates were similar  between the vaccinated pregnant and non-pregnant women (OR: 0.88, 95% CI:  0.00-268.11). No studies on efficacy and effectiveness could be found. Our  pooled analysis concluded that COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women in  India is not associated with the increased risk of AEFIs or maternal or fetal  outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common viral infection with  the potential for severe illness in infants, leading to thousands of pediatric  hospitalizations annually. In late 2023, Beyfortus (nirsevimab), a long-acting  monoclonal antibody, became available to provide passive RSV immunization for  all newborns meeting eligibility criteria. This study aimed to explore parental  decision-making regarding RSV immunization, particularly in comparison to family  uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, within an urban, predominantly  Medicaid population in North Philadelphia. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted at Temple University Hospital and  Temple Pediatric Care outpatient clinic. Semi-structured interviews were  performed with 25 parents and primary caregivers of newborns who received RSV  immunization during the 2023-2024 season. Participants were recruited from a  retrospective list and interviewed by phone using a standardized questionnaire.  Grounded Theory methodology was applied for data analysis using iterative coding  to identify themes related to immunization perceptions and acceptance. RESULTS: Participants expressed high levels of trust in healthcare providers and  prioritized safety and efficacy when making immunization decisions. Parents  accepted RSV immunization due to personal or family experiences with RSV,  general desire to protect their newborns, or pediatrician recommendation. In  contrast, COVID-19 and influenza vaccine decisions were less consistent.  Concerns about side effects and perceived lack of effectiveness were common  reasons for declining COVID-19 vaccines, despite similar motivations for  protection. Social media and political beliefs had minimal reported influence.  Parents reported a lack of consistent, reliable online sources for vaccine  information, often relying on general internet searches. Many misunderstood  immunization/vaccine efficacy, equating it with complete immunity rather than  reduced disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Parental acceptance of RSV immunization was driven by protective  instincts for newborns and familiarity with RSV as a disease. Hesitancy toward  COVID-19 vaccination stemmed largely from concerns about effectiveness and  confusion around immunization/vaccine purpose. Trust in medical professionals  influenced decision-making, though participants lacked a consistent source of  immunization information. Improved public education on immunization efficacy and  centralized access to trustworthy information may enhance immunization uptake  and address ongoing hesitancy across all pediatric immunizations.  © 2025.

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted routine immunizations worldwide,  decreasing confidence in vaccination programs. We used mixed methods to examine  changes in vaccine confidence from before to during the pandemic in HBV-negative  adults in Kinshasa who were exposed to HBV in the household, and eligible for  HBV vaccination. We measured changes in routine HBV vaccine confidence with a  previously validated Shift in Vaccine Confidence (SVC) self-report measure that  was verbally administered in Lingala (local language). We compared vaccination  confidence before versus during the pandemic using Chi-square tests. We also  interviewed participants and coded open-ended responses to the SVC scale to  explore context-specific perceptions. From April 2022 to February 2023, we  administered the SVC tool to a purposive sample of 41 participants: 7 vaccinees,  23 willing to receive HBV vaccine, and 11 refusers. Participants had a median  age of 32 years, were predominantly affiliated with Revivalist churches, and  most reported unemployment and no education beyond secondary school. We observed  statistically significant declines across all five vaccine confidence domains  when comparing responses before and during the pandemic (p < 0.01): vaccines  prevent diseases (85.4%-68.3%), are safe (80.5%-46.3%), important for a child's  health (92.7%-87.8%) and one's own health (87.8%-68.3%), and new vaccines carry  no more risk than routine vaccines (78.1%-63.5%). Qualitative analysis  identified four themes impacting uptake decisions: vaccine confidence,  knowledge, risks, and external influences. Rising uncertainty about efficacy,  safety, and distrust in the COVID-19 vaccine undermined vaccine confidence among  our participants. Factors such as distrust in manufacturers and government, fear  of side effects, perceived low illness risk, and inconvenient healthcare access  contributed to low vaccine uptake. These insights underscore the pandemic's  impact on routine immunization and emphasize the need for consideration in  future vaccination campaigns.  Copyright: © 2025 Boisson-Walsh et al.

Vaccine attitudes, practices, and literacy among New York State primary care  providers and their office personnel.  Suryadevara M(1), Wang D(2), Domachowske J(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.

Consistency of the healthcare delivery team's communication to families is  influential in vaccine decision-making. We aim to describe personal vaccine  practices, attitudes, and literacy among New York State primary care office  providers and personnel. We disseminated an anonymous survey to providers and  office personnel (including but not limited to front office staff, medical  assistance, nurses, advanced practice providers, and physicians) of 12 primary  care practices between May and July 2023. Responses were assessed using  chi-square tests, t-tests, and one way ANOVA tests to compare categorical  variables, the means between two groups, and means across multiple groups,  respectively. 216 respondents completed the survey. 25/213 (12%) and 16/147  (11%) reported declining routinely recommended vaccine(s) for themselves or for  their child(ren), respectively, most commonly the COVID-19 and/or influenza  vaccines. Less than three-quarters of respondents strongly agreed with the  following statements: vaccines are safe to administer to children (149/214,  70%), vaccines are safe to administer to adolescents (149/213, 70%), and  vaccines are effective in preventing disease (146/213, 69%). In total, 149/213  (70%) and 89/211 (42%) of respondents report that parents express concerns to  them about vaccines in the clinic and outside of the practice setting,  respectively, yet just over half of the respondents (116/210, 55%) report strong  agreement with being comfortable having vaccine conversations with parents.

The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic highlighted the urgent need for novel  small molecule antiviral drugs. (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 is a non-covalent SARS-CoV-2  main protease inhibitor developed by the open science collaboration COVID  Moonshot. Here, we report on the metabolic and toxicologic optimization of the  lead series previously disclosed by the COVID Moonshot Initiative, leading up to  the selection of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 as the preclinical candidate. We describe the  thorough profiling of the series, identifying key risks such as formation of  genotoxic metabolites and high clearance, which were successfully addressed  during lead optimization. In addition, we disclose the in vitro and in vivo  evaluation of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models,  exploring multiple approaches to ameliorate rodent-specific metabolic clearance,  and show that both co-dosing of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 with an ABT inhibitor and  utilizing a metabolically humanized mouse model (8HUM) achieve significant  improvements in exposure. Through comparisons of ABT co-dosing and humanized  mouse models in efficacy experiments, we demonstrate that continuous exposure  over cellular EC90 is required for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral efficacy in vivo in an  antiviral model using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain. Finally, (S)-x38  DNDI-6510 was assessed in maximum tolerated dose experiments in two species,  demonstrating significant in vivo PXR-linked auto-induction of metabolism,  leading to the discontinuation of this compound. In summary, we report the  successful effort to overcome series-specific AMES liabilities in a lead  development program. Downstream optimization of existing series will require  in-depth optimization of rodent-specific liabilities and metabolic induction  profile.

OBJECTIVES: Due to political polarization, adherence to public health measures  varied across US states during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although social media  posts have been shown effective in anticipating COVID-19 surges, the impact of  political leaning on the effectiveness of different topics for early warning  remains mostly unexplored. Our study examines the spatio-temporal early warning  potential of different geo-social media topics across republican, democrat, and  swing states. METHODS: Using keyword filtering, we identified eight COVID-19-related  geo-social media topics. We then utilized Chatterjee's rank correlation to  assess their early warning capability for COVID-19 cases 7 to 42 days in advance  across six infection waves. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate the impact  of timeframe and political leaning on the early warning capabilities of these  topics. RESULTS: Many topics exhibited significant spatial clustering over time, with  quarantine and vaccination-related posts occurring in opposing spatial regimes  in the second timeframe. We also found significant variation in the early  warning capabilities of geo-social media topics over time and across political  clusters. In detail, quarantine related geo-social media post were significantly  less correlated to COVID-19 cases in republican states than in democrat states.  Further, preventive measure and quarantine-related posts exhibited declining  correlations to COVID-19 cases over time, while the correlations of vaccine and  virus-related posts with COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the need for a dynamic spatially targeted  approach that accounts for both how regional geosocial media topics of interest  change over time and the impact of local political ideology on their  epidemiological early warning capabilities.

This systematic review evaluated the economic  evaluations of vaccines targeting respiratory infections in the region. A  comprehensive search was conducted across several databases, including  MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, NHSEED, CINAHL, EconLit, Web of Science, Scopus, and  Cochrane Library, up to April 24, 2024. Nineteen eligible studies were  identified, focusing primarily on influenza (8 studies) and COVID-19 vaccines (7  studies), with fewer studies on pneumococcal (2 studies), varicella (1 study),  and pertussis (1 study) vaccines. Overall, influenza, COVID-19 (boosters), and  pneumococcal vaccines were found to be cost-effective or highly cost-effective  compared to no-vaccine or no-booster scenarios. The only study on maternal  pertussis vaccination found it not to be cost-effective. The most common  parameters considered in sensitivity analyses were vaccine efficacy and discount  rates. This review highlights the economic evaluations of influenza, COVID-19,  and pneumococcal vaccines in Southeast Asia, providing essential evidence to  guide vaccine policy. Future studies should address limitations in model  selection, incorporate herd immunity, ensure the model validation (i.e. validity  of cost and benefit measurements), and explore the cost-effectiveness of other  vaccines across the region.

From institutional trust to digital literacy: Socioeconomic and political  determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Czech adults based on a  national panel survey.  Riad A(1)(2), Bahavan B(1), Koščik M(1)(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno,  Czech Republic. (2)Masaryk Centre for Global Health (MCGH), Department of Public Health, Faculty  of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.  Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant public health challenge, particularly  during pandemics when high immunization rates are crucial. While individual  psychological antecedents of vaccine hesitancy have been extensively studied,  limited empirical evidence exists on how contextual determinants, such as  socioeconomic status, political trust, and digital literacy, collectively shape  vaccine-related behaviors, particularly in Central European populations. This  study explores the key determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Czech  adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the 48th wave of  the Czech national panel survey Život během pandemie [Life During Pandemic],  carried out in March 2023. The data were obtained via an online questionnaire  administered to a nationally representative sample of Czech adults (n = 1,708).  Sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and anamnestic variables were examined  alongside political attitudes. Psychological antecedents of vaccination were  assessed using the 5C model (confidence, complacency, constraints, risk  calculation, and collective responsibility), and digital vaccine literacy was  measured using seven items covering trust in official sources, trust in social  media, and the ability to evaluate and apply vaccine information. Statistical  analyses included bivariate tests and multivariable regression models to  identify vaccine uptake and intent determinants. Higher trust in constitutional  institutions, including the president (OR = 1.55; 95/ CI: 1.38-1.74), government  (1.60; 1.38-1.85), Chamber of Deputies (1.73; 1.48-2.02), and Senate (1.47;  1.29-1.69), was significantly associated with higher vaccine uptake. Similarly,  positive attitudes toward the integration of Ukrainian refugees into Czech  society - across domains such as work (1.63; 1.39-1.90), housing (1.59;  1.36-1.86), school (1.64; 1.41-1.92), language (1.57; 1.34-1.84), and culture  (1.74; 1.50-2.03) - were positively associated with uptake. Greater confidence  in vaccine safety and effectiveness was also a significant predictor (1.51;  1.44-1.58). In contrast, lower education (0.64; 0.56-0.73), lower income (0.91;  0.86-0.95), female sex (0.60; 0.47-0.76), and higher complacency (0.76;  0.73-0.80) were associated with reduced uptake. Respondents with better digital  vaccine literacy, particularly those more adept at identifying misinformation,  showed significantly greater vaccine confidence (mean score: 3.62 vs. 3.30,  p < .001). Beyond psychological antecedents, institutional trust, political  orientation, and digital vaccine literacy significantly shape COVID-19  vaccination behaviors. These findings underscore the importance of targeted  interventions that address political and digital influences on vaccine  hesitancy, and they highlight the need for future research to examine the causal  pathways and longitudinal dynamics underlying these associations, particularly  within Central and Eastern European contexts.

(#)Contributed equally  Patients with psoriasis are vulnerable to infections due to dysregulated  immunity, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and comorbid conditions. Despite  ongoing concerns regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability in  patients with psoriasis, evidence remains limited. This nationwide,  population-based, retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the risk and  severity of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness in patients with psoriasis,  including those receiving immunomodulatory therapy, using Korean National Health  Insurance Service claims data from 2018 to 2021. The primary analysis included  167,746 patients with psoriasis and 866,582 controls, revealing no significant  associations between psoriasis and COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.99,  95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.04). Conversely, the secondary analysis of  3,131 patients with psoriasis and 265,475 controls revealed significantly higher  rates of severe COVID-19 in patients with psoriasis (aHR: 1.33, 95% CI:  1.08-1.64). While some treatment subgroups - such as the cyclosporine and  methotrexate subgroups - demonstrated higher incidences of COVID-19 than the  reference (nonsystemic) subgroup, these differences were not statistically  significant. Furthermore, vaccine interaction effects between the duration of  immunity and psoriasis or each treatment were insignificant (all P > 0.05).  Patients with psoriasis exhibited a higher risk of severe COVID-19; however,  their COVID-19 susceptibility and vaccine effectiveness resembled those of the  control group. Additionally, the use of immunomodulatory agents did not impact  COVID-19 risk or vaccine effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for  dermatologists to implement pre- and postinfection strategies tailored for  patients with psoriasis.  © 2025. The Author(s).

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of the third, fourth, and fifth booster doses  (rolled out in December 2021, June 2022, and October 2022, respectively) of the  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in Japanese haemodialysis patients  during the Omicron era. METHODS: We analysed the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy Renal Data  Registry (JRDR) year-end survey data from 2021 to 2022, which included  information on the number of vaccinations and the most recent vaccination and  infection months. For each month of 2022, the COVID-19 infection and related  mortality risks were calculated by vaccination status, followed by logistic  regression analyses to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: Overall, 225 887 patients were analysed, including 13 440 (5.9%),  25 547 (11.3%), 64 242 (28.4%), and 122 658 (54.3%) with ≤ 2, 3, 4, and 5 doses  at the end of 2022, respectively. The third dose was significantly correlated  with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection in early 2022 (March: aOR 0.53  [0.43-0.64]; April: 0.77 [0.63-0.95]) but was associated with a higher risk  during mid-2022, coinciding with the BA.1/2 to BA.5 transition (July: 1.65  [1.39-1.95]; August: 2.37 [2.06-2.71]). The third dose consistently correlated  with reduced COVID-19-related mortality. The fourth and fifth doses correlated  with lower infection risk and COVID-19-related mortality throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese haemodialysis patients, the third to fifth COVID-19  vaccine doses were associated with reduced infection risk (except in July and  August for third doses) and mortality.  © 2025 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies in mitigating  the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While a connection between poor  nutritional status and diminished immune responses to vaccination has been  noted, comprehensive reviews elucidating this association have been scarce. To  address this gap, we conducted a scoping review to characterise the relationship  between nutritional status (specifically, body mass index (BMI) or micronutrient  deficiencies) and the responses to COVID-19 vaccination, encompassing efficacy,  effectiveness, and immunogenicity. METHOD: We searched PubMed, OVID-Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Covid Register,  LitCovid, and WHO COVID-19 research databases for studies that reported the  association between nutritional status and responses to the COVID-19 vaccines  (published between December 20, 2019, and December 30, 2023). Two reviewers  independently screened the articles, and disagreements were resolved through  consensus or by a third reviewer. RESULTS: Seventy-three out of 1,853 identified articles were included in this  review, predominantly featuring cohort designs (72%). Among these studies, 63%  reported BMI, 30% focused on micronutrients (specifically vitamin D, selenium,  iron, zinc), and 6% examined both. Most studies (84%) focused on vaccine  immunogenicity. The most frequently studied vaccines were BNT162b2 (Pfizer,  74%), ChAdOx (AstraZeneca, 23%), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna, 14%). High BMI  significantly reduced COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity in 23 studies, while  adequate vitamin D was associated with increased vaccine response in seven  studies. CONCLUSION: Overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (vitamin D, iron,  selenium and zinc) have been observed to attenuate the potency of COVID-19  vaccines. Future strategies aimed at prioritizing vaccination in obese and  overweight individuals, or enhancing their vaccine response, may involve  identifying measures such as the provision of booster doses. Additionally,  efforts should ensure micronutrient adequacy, including improving vitamin D  status through strategies like increased sun exposure or supplementation,  particularly for deficient individuals.  © 2025.

IMPORTANCE: The effect of metformin on reducing symptom duration among  outpatient adults with COVID-19 has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess metformin compared with placebo for symptom resolution  during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic  Interventions and Vaccines platform evaluated repurposed medications for mild to  moderate COVID-19. Between September 19, 2023, and May 1, 2024, participants 30  years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2 or more COVID-19  symptoms for 7 days or less were included at 90 US sites. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive metformin (titrated to  1500 mg, daily) or placebo for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery  (3 consecutive days without COVID-19 symptoms) within 28 days of receiving the  study drug. Secondary outcomes included time to clinic visit, emergency  department (ED) visit, hospitalization, or death. Safety events of interest were  hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. RESULTS: Among 2991 participants who were randomized and received study drug,  the median age was 47 (IQR, 38-58) years; 1895 (63.4%) were female, 25 (0.8%)  were American Indian of Alaska Native, 77 (2.6%) were Asian, 350 (11.7%) were  Black, African American, or African, 1392 (46.5%) identified as Hispanic or  Latino, 8 (0.3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2395 (80.1%)  were White, and 2044 (68.3%) reported 2 or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Among 1443 (48.2%) participants who received metformin and 1548 (51.8%) who  received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not observed  (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.89-1.03; P for  efficacy = .11). The median time to sustained recovery was 9 days (95% CI, 9-10)  for metformin and 10 days (95% CI, 9-10) for placebo. No deaths were reported;  103 participants reported clinic visits, ED visits, or hospitalization: 54 in  the metformin group and 49 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CrI,  0.82-1.78; P for efficacy = .13). Overall, 35 (1.2%) reported ED visits or  hospitalization (1.1% in the metformin and 1.3% in the placebo group). Seven  participants who received metformin and 3 who received placebo experienced a  serious adverse event over 180 days. There were 4 episodes of  participant-reported hypoglycemia in the placebo group and 2 in the metformin  group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, metformin was not  shown to shorten the time to symptom resolution in low-risk adults with  COVID-19. The median days to symptom resolution was numerically but not  significantly lower for metformin. Safety was not a limitation in the study  population.

OBJECTIVE: The global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic requires a  comprehensive assessment of vaccine efficacy, including both humoral and  cellular immune responses. This study aimed to determine the effects of  CoronaVac and BNT162b2 booster doses on quantitative immunoglobulin G (IgG) and  interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses of individuals primed with two doses of  CoronaVac in Türkiye. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included participants aged  18-59 years, without comorbidities, who were not under drug therapy and had no  clinical history of COVID-19 and primed with CoronaVac. Participants were  divided into three groups: Group 1 received a single CoronaVac booster, Group 2  received a single BNT162b2 booster, and Group 3 received two BNT162b2 boosters.  Humoral immunity was assessed by the determination of IgG levels against the  spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2, and cellular immunity  was assessed by the IFN-γ release assay. RESULTS: The study included 48 participants. When the 6-12-month  post-vaccination period was considered, the lowest quantitative IgG levels were  detected in Group 1. Higher IgG levels were detected in Group 2 and Group 3,  with Group 3 revealing the highest levels for both IgG and IFN-γ responses.  Although the differences between the IFN-γ levels among the three groups were  not statistically significant, the individuals boosted with the BNT162b2  demonstrated two- and three-fold higher levels compared to the homologous  boosted individuals. The median IgG and IFN-γ values were significantly higher  in the younger participants compared to the older participants in Group 3. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that although homologous and heterologous  boosting in inactivated vaccine-primed individuals provided effective humoral  and cellular immunity, boosting with two doses of BNT162b2 should be prioritized  since it exhibited a positive impact on both humoral and cellular immunity.

Effects of K-12 School District Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on  Community-Level Prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infection During the COVID-19  Pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, kindergarten through 12th grade  schools implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The effects of  school-based NPIs on broader community levels of acute respiratory infection  (ARI) have not been defined. We utilized an existing longitudinal cohort of  households reporting weekly ARI cases to evaluate the effects of evolving school  districtwide NPIs on ARI activity at eight transition points from December 2019  through October 2022. METHODS: Household ARI data were reported through the GReat Oregon Child  Absenteeism due to Respiratory Disease Study (ORCHARDS) Vaccine Effectiveness  Study-a prospective cohort study based in the Oregon School District (OSD)  (GROVES). Participating GROVES families completed weekly online surveys with  respiratory illness updates. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to  examine the association between eight school-related transition events during  the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the trajectory of ARI risk for GROVES  family members, while accounting for family clusters. Transition events were  assessed using a ±4-week window of community data. RESULTS: Opening schools with maximal NPIs (mandated masking and physical  distancing, with hybrid education) was not associated with increased community  ARI activity. The four transition events associated with significant ARI risk  trajectory increases included summer breaks (June 2020, p = 0.001; June 2021,  p = 0.002), and the start of school with mandatory masking only (September 2021,  p < 0.001) or without NPIs (September 2022, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: School-based NPI implementation was associated with reduced risks  for community ARI activity. Enhanced surveillance platforms such as the weekly  online surveys used in this study are valuable tools for better understanding  and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory virus transmission in schools and  surrounding communities.  © 2025 The Author(s).

This study aims to explore the  attitudes of pregnant women in Pakistan regarding COVID-19 vaccination  decision-making and to identify the factors influencing their vaccine uptake. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of pregnant women was conducted at two  hospitals in Karachi in February-May 2024. The survey included a four-point  Likert scale to evaluate 19 attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination during  pregnancy. These attitudes were later grouped into nine categories: disease risk  perception, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine safety, general hesitancy (including  concerns about vaccine ingredients), self-efficacy, social norms and family  norms. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify attitudes  associated with vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Among the 400 women surveyed, 46 % (95 %CI: 41-51) reported being  vaccinated against. COVID-19. Participants with higher COVID-19 risk perception  were 5.71 times more likely to be vaccinated than their counterparts (95 %CI:  2.65-12.29). Those with higher self-efficacy and those who believed their  friends or family had received or would receive the vaccine, had 2.28 (95 %CI:  1.08-4.65) times and 2.19 (95 %CI: 1.03-4.65) times higher odds of being  vaccinated, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for general vaccine hesitancy  was 0.37 (95 %CI: 0.18-0.78), indicating that women with higher hesitancy were  63 % less likely to be vaccinated compared to those with lower hesitancy.  Furthermore, women with less support from family regarding vaccine  decision-making were 69 % less likely to be vaccinated than those who received  more support. CONCLUSION: Attitudes associated with increased vaccination among pregnant women  were higher COVID-19 risk perception, higher self-efficacy, and supportive  social norms. In contrast, general vaccine hesitancy, and unsupportive family  norms were significant barriers to vaccination during pregnancy. Targeted  strategies are needed to address women's concerns about vaccine ingredients and  promote supportive family influences, enhancing vaccine uptake in this important  group.

Electronic address:  nico.lingg@boku.ac.at.  Influenza viruses pose a significant public health threat, causing seasonal  epidemics and occasional pandemics with substantial morbidity and mortality  worldwide. The development of effective vaccines remains crucial for mitigating  the impact of influenza virus infections. The influenza virus possesses two  glycoproteins on its surface: hemagglutinin, which is immunodominant, and  neuraminidase, which is immunosubdominant. Traditional influenza vaccines  primarily target the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin to induce  protective immunity. However, the high mutation rate of this protein,  particularly in response to selective pressure from immune responses, limits the  durability and efficacy of current vaccines. Efficient production of influenza  vaccines relies on scalable purification processes to ensure safe and  efficacious antigens. Neuraminidase (NA), the second glycoprotein of influenza  virus, has recently emerged as target for broadly protective protein subunit  vaccine formulations, necessitating development of robust manufacturing and  characterization methods for this antigen. Here we present a scalable approach  for purifying recombinant NA, expressed in insect cells utilizing the  baculovirus expression system. Lean purification processes, based on  chromatography and tangential flow filtration, achieve high yield and purity  while maintaining the target's structural integrity and biological activity. The  purified product is characterized through a variety of techniques, which confirm  its structural and functional properties, and the consistency of those  throughout the experiments performed. Scalability from laboratory to  manufacturing scale under good manufacturing practice (GMP) ensures  reproducibility, thus advancing the development of recombinant NA-based vaccines  for comprehensive influenza control.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a cell wall-deficient pathogen, primarily affects  children and adolescents, causing Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP).  Following the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) post  COVID-19, there has been a global increase in MPP cases and macrolide-resistant  strains. Vaccination against M. pneumoniae is being explored as a promising  approach to reduce infections, limit antibiotic misuse, and prevent the  emergence of drug-resistant variants. We developed an mRNA vaccine, mRNA-SP+P1,  incorporating a eukaryotic signal peptide (tissue-type plasminogen activator  signal peptide) fused to the C-terminal region of the P1 protein. Targeting  amino acids 1288 to 1518 of the P1 protein, the vaccine was administered  intramuscularly to BALB/c mice in a three-dose regimen. To evaluate  immunogenicity, we quantified anti-P1 IgG antibody titers using enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and assessed cellular immune responses by  analyzing effector memory T cell populations using flow cytometry. We also  tested the functional activity of vaccine-induced sera for their ability to  inhibit adhesion of the ATCC M129 strain to KMB17 cells. The vaccine's  protective efficacy was assessed against the ATCC M129 strain and its  cross-protection against the ST3-resistant strain. Transcriptomic analysis was  conducted to investigate gene expression changes in peripheral blood, aiming to  uncover mechanisms of immune modulation. The mRNA-SP+P1 vaccine induces P1  protein-specific IgG antibodies and an effector memory T-cell response in BALB/c  mice. Adhesion inhibition assays demonstrated that serum from vaccinated mice  attenuatesthe adhesion ability of ATCC M129 to KMB17 cells. Furthermore, three  doses of the vaccine confer significant and long-lasting, though partial,  protection against the ATCC M129 strain and partial cross-protection against the  ST3 drug-resistant strain. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant gene  expression changes in peripheral blood, confirming the vaccine's capacity to  elicit an immune response from the molecular level. Our results indicate that  the mRNA-SP+P1 vaccine appears to be an effective vaccine candidate against the  prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Chen C(1), Zhang Z(1), Zheng Q(1), Zhou Y(1), Zhang S(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical  Sciences, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou 646000, China.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has undergone several mutations  since 2020, and novel variants continue to emerge to this day. The immune escape  ability of the emerging mutants is enhanced and results in robust  transmissibility. The neutralizing ability of the antibodies produced in the  human body during previous infections is decreased against some of these  mutants, which poses a severe challenge to the preventive and therapeutic  effectiveness of vaccines and antibody drugs. The nucleocapsid protein is one of  the main structural proteins of the coronavirus and plays an important role in  the life cycle of the novel coronavirus. This protein is one of the key targets  for drug development, and the first major step in drug development is to obtain  pure nucleocapsid proteins. However, since nucleocapsid proteins have a nucleic  acid-binding function and automatically undergo liquid-liquid phase separation  and agglomeration, the purification of full-length nucleocapsids is challenging.  In this context, a set of easy-to-operate processes was developed in this study  for the purification of nucleocapsid proteins. Finally, a pure full-length  nucleocapsid protein without nucleic acid contamination was obtained, which  exhibited significantly enhanced accessibility for structural and functional  virological studies, vaccine development, and related research applications.  Further, the nucleic acid-binding domain of the nucleocapsid protein was  targeted, and potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  inhibitors were identified using virtual screening and biolayer interferometry  technology. Notably, the eukaryotically expressed nucleocapsid protein  demonstrated a significantly greater binding affinity for Light Green SF  Yellowish (KD = 119.7 nM) compared to that demonstrated by its prokaryotic  counterpart (KD = 19.9 × 103 nM). The findings of this study suggest the  importance of considering both protein source and post-translational  modifications of the target proteins to be used in drug screening workflows.  Therefore, this compound not only represents a novel therapeutic candidate for  COVID-19 but also a critical tool for elucidating antiviral mechanisms.

Wimalawansa SJ(1).  Author information: (1)CardioMetabolic & Endocrine Institute, North Brunswick, NJ 08902, USA.  Neglecting preventive healthcare policies has contributed to the global surge in  chronic diseases, increased hospitalizations, declining quality of care, and  escalating costs. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)-notably cardiovascular  conditions, diabetes, and cancer-consume over 80% of healthcare expenditure and  account for more than 60% of global deaths, which are projected to exceed 75% by  2030. Poor diets, sedentary lifestyles, regulatory loopholes, and underfunded  public health initiatives are driving this crisis. Compounding the issue are  flawed policies, congressional lobbying, and conflicts of interest that  prioritize costly, hospital-based, symptom-driven care over identifying and  treating to eliminate root causes and disease prevention. Regulatory agencies  are failing to deliver their intended functions. For instance, the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration's (FDA) broad oversight across drugs, devices, food, and  supplements has resulted in inefficiencies, reduced transparency, and public  safety risks. This broad mandate has allowed the release of unsafe drugs, food  additives, and supplements, contributing to the rising childhood diseases, the  burden of chronic illness, and over-medicalization. The author proposes  separating oversight responsibilities: transferring authority over food,  supplements, and OTC products to a new Food and Nutraceutical Agency (FNA),  allowing the FDA to be restructured as the Drug and Device Agency (DDA), to  refocus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. While complete reform requires  Congressional action, interim policy shifts are urgently needed to improve  public health. Broader structural changes-including overhauling the Affordable  Care Act, eliminating waste and fraud, redesigning regulatory and insurance  systems, and eliminating intermediaries are essential to reducing costs,  improving care, and transforming national and global health outcomes. The  information provided herein can serve as a White Paper to help reform health  agencies and healthcare systems for greater efficiency and lower costs in the  USA and globally.  DOI: 10.3390/foods14132328 PMCID: PMC12248432 PMID: 40647079  Conflict of interest statement: Financial ties between FDA officials and the  pharmaceutical industry have undermined public trust [169]. Despite  disagreements over fragmented and insufficient evidence, these excessively close  associations between FDA and CDC directors and pharmaceutical company sponsors  the approval of drugs suggest undue influence in the FDA’s decision process  [170,171]. In addition to barring the current too-close associations, it is  essential to have stricter policies on post-tenure pharma employment  prohibitions, which are necessary for impartiality and to regain the lost public  trust [169]. These are essential to restore credibility of the FDA and the trust  of the public. Ensuring transparency in drug approvals remains a critical issue,  with concerns about the FDA approving drugs based on borderline results,  tolerating protocol violations in clinical trials, and accepting data with  inadequate statistical power from pharmaceutical companies [73,158].  Additionally, the denial of drugs that should have been approved due to  conflicts of interest within the industry has raised additional ethical concerns  [35,172]. Close associations between FDA officials and pharmaceutical sponsors  as well as disagreements over insufficient evidence, suggest undue industry  influence on the approval process [159,173]. The FDA’s persistent lack of  transparency during drug evaluations and refusal to allow independent scientists  to review original clinical trial (RCT) data, safety, and efficacy (as with the  COVID-19 vaccine) has eroded its credibility and trust [171]. This oversight is  crucial for physicians and patients to identify biases and make informed  decisions [157]. However, superficial reforms, claims without substantive  changes, will not address these issues [174]. The Congressional FDA Reform Act  of 2012 failed to eliminate conflicts of interest among FDA employees and  government agencies [35,159]. Without strict oversight and accountability, the  integrity of the drug and medical device approval process remains compromised,  undermining public trust. These external factors, often from drug companies or  other stakeholders, exercise inappropriate pressure on the FDA staff to approve  a drug or medical device, which could potentially compromise the scientific  review process [173], and prioritizes commercial interests over public health  concerns [172]. Addressing this issue requires enacting a new Act to eliminate  conflicts of interest across government agencies [173]. A major controversy was  the approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and antivirals under Emergency Use  Authorization despite the availability of cost-effective generic treatments in  2020 [70,71,82,177,178,179,180]. The FDA’s refusal to approve repurposed,  effective generic compounds like vitamin D and ivermectin for SARS-CoV-2 [177]  led to overwhelmed hospital staff and resources with patients, and unnecessary  loss of lives [70,71,72,82]. The DHHS should ensure that such a harmful scenario  will not be repeated. Closing regulatory loopholes, eliminating favoritism  toward big pharma, and preventing conflicts of interest in the FDA and CDC are  crucial [35,172,173]. Cozy relationships between FDA directors and  pharmaceutical sponsors and disagreements over insufficient evidence suggest an  unwarranted influence on FDA approvals [170,172]. The public considered the  non-approval of widely available generics and early therapies against SARS-CoV-2  to be due to conflicts of interest; it had significant negative consequences  [71,72]. Policymakers must close these loopholes and enact stronger laws to  prevent undue industry influence across the FDA, CDC, and other government  agencies [159]. Approvals despite borderline results, tolerating shortcuts in  RCTs, and denying economic agents claimed due to ‘insufficient’ evidence further  raise concerns of serious conflicts and affect the credibility of the FDA [172].  A new Congressional Act is essential to eliminate conflicts of interest within  government agencies [35,170]. The author has no conflicts of interest. He has  not received funding, influence, assistance, or professional writing for this  perspective policy article."

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies may protect against symptomatic  infection in immunized individuals. However, vaccine-induced antibody levels  wane over time, reducing vaccine efficacy. The definition of the waning kinetics  of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 responses and the potential impact of sequential  antigen encounters are still poorly defined. METHODS: Plasma neutralizing activity was determined in longitudinally collected  samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected, primo-vaccinated and boosted individuals.  Neutralizing activity decay kinetics were modeled against time using Log-Log and  biexponential models. RESULTS: Neutralizing antibody levels wane after an initial peak in all groups  of vaccinated individuals with half-life ranging from 29 to 60 days. Exponential  models showed a subsequent stabilization of neutralizing titers to a plateau.  Both the peak response and the plateau values depended on vaccine type,  infection status and severity of infection. Booster immunization by either  vaccines or breakthrough infections did not modify peak, plateau or decay rate  values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the waning of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing  antibody responses was recurrent even after several antigen encounters. Repeated  immunizations would be required to maintain high levels of neutralizing  antibodies and protect vulnerable individuals from symptomatic infection.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the association between COVID-19  vaccination status and all-cause mortality (ACM) rate in the population of the  Czech Republic between January 2020 and December 2022. METHODS: In this retrospective study based on official population-wide  individual (record-level) data, we analyzed monthly ACM rates stratified by  COVID-19 vaccination status, sex, and age. The ACM was compared to expected  mortality based on pre-COVID data. The recipients of the Janssen vaccine were  excluded from the study. The final dataset comprised N = 5,636,949 individuals  from the Czech Republic, encompassing all residents born between 1925 and 1980  who were alive on January 1, 2020. RESULTS: Multiple peculiar patterns in ACM were revealed. The ACM of vaccinated  individuals across several age cohorts was greatly diminished compared to the  ACM of the unvaccinated, even in periods when virtually no COVID-19-related  deaths were observed, suggesting a strong selection/indication bias. A similar  drop in the ACM of newly vaccinated individuals was observed again during the  booster campaign. With time from vaccination, the differences in ACM between  groups with different vaccination statuses dwindled. Indication bias was  observed at the beginning of the vaccination campaign when the frailest  individuals were preferentially vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The population-wide data strongly suggest the presence of  selection/indication bias, warranting careful interpretation of vaccination  effectiveness estimates derived from observational studies.  © 2025.

Development of mucosal influenza virus vaccines which protect the site of viral  entry is of high importance. Recombinant neuraminidase (NA) has emerged as an  antigenically conserved intranasal vaccine candidate, capable of inducing broad  cross-protection, but it requires effective mucosal adjuvants. Here, we analyze  the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a mucosal recombinant NA-based  influenza virus vaccine adjuvanted with the outer membrane proteins from  Neisseria meningitidis complexed with exogenous lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from  Shigella flexneri or endogenous LPS from N. meningitidis. We observed increased  follicular T-helper and germinal center B-cell population percentages in  nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, enhanced IgA and IgG antibody responses, and  accumulation of lung-resident memory T cells. The vaccine provided complete  protection against homologous and partial protection against a heterologous  influenza virus (clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1) challenge. These findings underscore the  potential of bacterial membrane-derived adjuvants for developing robust mucosal  influenza vaccines.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: mRNA-1283 is an investigational, next-generation COVID-19 vaccine  that encodes only the immunodominant regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-the  receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain rather than the  full-length spike used in currently authorised mRNA vaccines. We evaluated the  relative vaccine efficacy (rVE), immunogenicity, and safety of mRNA-1283  compared to the first-generation vaccine (mRNA-1273). METHODS: This randomised, observer-masked, active-controlled, phase 3 trial  (NextCOVE) was conducted in individuals (aged ≥12 years) with no evidence of  SARS-CoV-2 infection within 90 days of screening in the USA, the UK, and Canada.  Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one 10 μg dose of  the bivalent formulation of mRNA-1283 (original plus omicron BA.4/BA.5) or 50 μg  of the bivalent mRNA-1273, encoding the same variants. Randomisation was  stratified by age (12-17 years, 18-64 years, and ≥65 years). Primary objectives  comparing mRNA-1283 with mRNA-1273 were non-inferior rVE to prevent a first  event of COVID-19 from 14 days after study injection to the end of follow-up  (assessed in the per-protocol set for efficacy, with non-inferiority declared  when the lower bound of the α-adjusted two-sided CI for rVE was greater than  -10%), non-inferior immunogenicity at day 29 (assessed in the per-protocol  immunogenicity subset, with non-inferiority declared when the lower bounds of  the CIs for the geometric mean concentration ratios [GMRs] of neutralising  antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 D614G and omicron BA.4/BA.5 were >0·667 and the  lower bounds of the 95% CI seroresponse rate differences for the two variants  were greater than -10%), and safety (assessed in the safety set, which included  all participants who received a vaccination). The trial is registered at  ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05815498) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between March 28 and Aug 23, 2023, we screened 13 054 individuals for  eligibility and randomly allocated 11 454 participants (5728 to mRNA-1283 and  5726 to mRNA-1273). 1177 confirmed COVID-19 events occurred up to Jan 31, 2024  (560 [9·9%] of 5679 in mRNA1283.222 and 617 [10·8%] of 5687 in mRNA-1273.222).  The median age of participants at enrolment was 56 years (IQR 38-66). Of the  11 417 participants who received a vaccine, 6200 (54·3%) were female and 5217  (45·7%) were male; 9381 (82·2%) were White; and 1510 (13·2%) were Hispanic or  Latino. Of the total cohort, 992 (8·7%) participants were aged 12-17 years, 7151  (62·6%) were aged 18-64 years, and 3274 (28·7%) were 65 years and older; in  addition, 6857 participants (60·1%) were 50 years and older. The rVE point  estimate was 9·3% (99·4% CI -6·6 to 22·8; p=0·0005). The GMR was 1·3 (95% CI 1·2  to 1·5) for BA.4/BA.5 and 1·2 (1·1 to 1·4) for D614G. The day-29 seroresponse  rate difference was 14·4% (95% CI 9·3 to 19·4) for BA.4/BA.5 and 10·7% (6·0 to  15·4) for D614G. Local and systemic adverse reactions were similar between  mRNA-1283 and mRNA-1273; mRNA-1283 was associated with fewer injection-site pain  reactions than mRNA-1273 (3905 [68·5%] of 5701 vs 4419 [77·5%] of 5705,  respectively). The frequency of unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse  events, and medically attended adverse events were similar between groups during  the first 28 days after injection. One event of sudden death occurred in a  participant with underlying cardiovascular disease in the mRNA-1273 group; it  was reported as related to vaccination due to its temporal association. INTERPRETATION: mRNA-1283 was well-tolerated. The rVE and immunogenicity  non-inferiority criteria were met, with higher antibody responses for mRNA-1283  versus mRNA-1273. The potential clinical benefit of mRNA-1283 versus mRNA-1273  needs to be confirmed in post-marketing evaluation. FUNDING: Moderna.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the effectiveness of a multi-component behavioural  nudge intervention to improve COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake among  pregnant women. METHODS: A 'nudge' was developed that comprised three SMS text message reminders  with a social norming message, links to vaccine safety information, videos of  health professionals and consumers recommending vaccination in pregnancy and a  pledge to get vaccinated. In separate RCTs, pregnant women who had not received  an influenza vaccine during the 2023 influenza season, or received ≤2 doses of a  COVID-19 vaccine, were randomised (1:1) to standard care or intervention at four  hospitals in Australia. RESULTS: A total of 1090 and 1068 pregnant women were randomised to the COVID-19  and influenza RCTs, respectively. The nudges resulted in a 1.6 % increase in  COVID-19 vaccine uptake and 1.7 % increase in influenza vaccine uptake among  pregnant women. However, there was no significant difference in the percentage  of pregnant women in the intervention (2.7 %) and the standard care (1.1 %)  groups receiving one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from randomisation until  delivery (odds ratio, 2.40; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 6.30,  P = 0.08). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the percentage of  pregnant women in the intervention (58.0 %) and the standard care (56.3 %)  groups receiving the influenza vaccine from the time of randomisation until  delivery (odds ratio, 1.07; 95 % CI, 0.84 to 1.38, P = 0.58). Less than 2 % of  women had viewed the video content of the nudges in both RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: The nudges delivered via SMS resulted in small increases in  COVID-19 and influenza vaccination uptake among pregnant women. Considering the  very low cost of bulk SMS, these nudges may be cost-effective interventions at a  population level.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

We evaluated neutralizing antibody responses against JN.1 and its  derivatives (KP.3, KP.3.1.1, LB.1, and XEC) in healthcare workers who received  seven doses of BNT162b2, including the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine. In  COVID-19-naïve individuals, KP.3.1.1 and LB.1 showed substantial immune escape,  whereas previously infected individuals maintained neutralization activity  against all variants. We also demonstrated that JN.1-based immunization induces  robust cross-neutralizing activity against emerging variants. A single amino  acid deletion at position 31 in the spike protein may be associated with  enhanced immune evasion. These findings support the potential effectiveness of  JN.1-based vaccines while highlighting the need for continued surveillance and  vaccine optimization.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Discrete choice experiments  have emerged as a valuable tool for understanding preferences regarding  vaccination. This study systematically reviews discrete choice experiments  conducted on COVID-19 public vaccination preferences to identify key  determinants influencing vaccine uptake and to assess methodological approaches  used in these studies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted across major databases,  including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify discrete choice  experiments focusing on COVID-19 vaccination preferences up to 31 December,  2024. Attribute categorization into five dimensions Outcome, Process, Cost,  Trust, and Framing was performed and quality appraised according to the DIRECT  checklist. Conditional relative importance as well as geographical differences  were assessed. RESULTS: The review identified 58 studies employing discrete choice experiments  that assessed public COVID-19 vaccine preferences. Among attribute categories,  outcome-related factors were the most frequently used and had the highest  relative importance. Other commonly evaluated attributes included cost,  origin/brand, and required doses. A notable geographic disparity was observed,  with studies being unevenly distributed across different regions. Methodological  heterogeneity was observed in attribute selection and experimental design. CONCLUSIONS: This review emphasizes the importance of considering individual  preferences into vaccination strategies to enhance uptake, particularly in  preparation for future pandemics. The findings reveal that vaccine effectiveness  and safety are key concerns for individuals. Future research could focus on  increasing representation of underexamined regions in preference studies to  better inform local policymakers in developing effective vaccination programs  for future health crises.

(4)Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, Westborough, Massachusetts, USA.  INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) often receive  immunosuppressive treatments. While approved COVID-19 vaccines effectively  prevent severe infections, the impact of vaccination among immunocompromised MG  patients remains unclear. This study explored vaccination status, adverse  events, and post-vaccination outcomes among MG patients. METHODS: A REDCap survey was conducted between September 21, 2021 and November  18, 2021 through the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America to collect data on  demographic and disease characteristics, COVID-19 infections, vaccination  status, and precaution strategies. A follow-up survey was available from January  11, 2022 to March 8, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 1205 participants [65.7% female, average age  59.6 ± 15.4 years] completed the survey. Most were White or Caucasian (87.9%),  63.6% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 41.9% were retired. Acetylcholine  receptor (AChR) antibody positivity was reported by 47%, MuSK-Ab positivity by  6.1%, and 19.6% were seronegative. Most (75%) were on immunosuppressive therapy,  and the vaccination rate was 91.5%. Among COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 61.5%  reported adverse effects, while 8.5% of participants remained unvaccinated due  to concerns about side effects (65%) and potential worsening of MG symptoms  (70.9%). Post-vaccination COVID-19 infection rates dropped from 9.7% to 2.4%.  Hospitalization decreased from 2.3% to 0.3%, and MG exacerbation rates from 5.5%  to 1.4%. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 vaccination acceptance is high among MG patients. Reported  side effects in MG patients were comparable to those in the general population,  and vaccination was associated with a reduced COVID-19 infection rate.  Addressing concerns about vaccine side effects and providing efficacy data  specific to MG could aid unvaccinated individuals in decision-making.  © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral  infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment  strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is  important for public health policies. AIM: This article aims to determine the relationship between dynamicity and  immune response interactions between Mpox and COVID-19, focusing more on the  implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine efficacy. METHODOLOGY: An extensive literature review was conducted through electronic  databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from the last  decade (2014-2024) using keywords: COVID-19, Co-infections, Immune response,  Monkeypox, and Vaccination. RESULTS: Several co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported,  especially a case from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in  Barcelona, Spain (a 56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and  syphilis simultaneously, and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and  Mpox have been shown to have some effects on the immunity of a person,  especially the innate system, which can occasionally produce inadvertent  effects. A common factor that links the two diseases is the endoglycosidase  named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 and Mpox clinical features have bizarre  severity and complications. The rising co-infection of COVID-19 and increased  Mpox infection rate has led to the development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS  and COH04S1. CONCLUSION: Global efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through  webinars, social media platforms, and research, including experimental studies,  cohort studies, case series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights  into both diseases. Such efforts should be backed up with good political will,  adequate funding, the establishment of research facilities and interprofessional  measures among the concerned countries and policymakers in the world.  © 2025.

The gut microbiota plays a key role in shaping immune responses, including those  induced by vaccination. Its impact on the humoral response to mRNA-based  SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, however, remains underexplored. We analyzed gut microbiota  composition and anti-Spike (S) IgG levels in 50 healthcare workers vaccinated  with the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Participants were stratified into low,  medium, and high responders based on IgG titers 30 days post-vaccination. Stool  samples were collected at baseline, and 16 S rRNA sequencing was used to assess  microbiota diversity and taxonomic profiles. Alpha diversity indices showed no  significant differences across response groups. However, specific microbial  signatures were associated with vaccine response. Higher relative abundance of  Clostridia, Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, and Odoribacter splanchnicus  correlated with stronger IgG responses. Functional microbiome analysis revealed  enrichment of acetate-producing pathways in high responders (p = 0.012),  suggesting a role for short-chain fatty acids in enhancing vaccine-induced  immunity. Logistic regression and Random Forest models identified these taxa as  predictors of strong antibody responses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for  individual taxa ranged from 0.70 to 0.76, indicating moderate predictive  performance. Conversely, taxa such as Hallella and Sutterella wadsworthensis  were linked to lower responses. These findings support a modulatory role of the  gut microbiota in mRNA vaccine immunogenicity and highlight microbial metabolic  functions as potential targets to boost vaccine efficacy in personalized  immunization strategies.  © 2025.

To investigate the potential association between COVID-19 vaccination and  Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, offering novel insights for the diagnosis  and management of vaccine-related ocular disorders. A case report combined with  a literature review was conducted. A 19-year-old male developing VKH after  receiving the second dose of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was analyzed.  Clinical features, treatment outcomes (glucocorticoid therapy with 2-year  follow-up), and literature-based comparisons were evaluated. PubMed-indexed  cases of vaccine-associated VKH were systematically reviewed, and causality was  assessed using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale. The patient  presented with bilateral blurred vision 14 days post-vaccination, diagnosed as  VKH with retinal neuroepithelial detachment via fluorescein angiography (FFA)  and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Oral prednisone (starting at 60 mg/day,  tapered gradually)restored visual acuity to near-normal levels (OD: 20/40, OS:  20/33), consistent with the patient's reported baseline vision. Within 8 weeks,  with no recurrence during follow-up. Literature analysis revealed  vaccine-associated VKH symptoms typically emerged at a median of 8 days  post-vaccination, aligning with the WHO's 40-day adverse event monitoring  window. A Naranjo score of 4 indicated a probable vaccine-triggered immune  response. COVID-19 vaccines may induce VKH via immune dysregulation mechanisms,  particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Although causality remains  unconfirmed, clinicians should maintain vigilance for acute bilateral uveitis  post-vaccination. Glucocorticoid therapy demonstrates efficacy in symptom  resolution and relapse prevention. Enhanced active surveillance and mechanistic  studies on vaccine-related ocular adverse events are warranted.  DOI: 10.1080/25785826.2025.2528331 PMID: 40631953"

Machine learning enables de novo multi-epitope design of plasmodium falciparum  circumsporozoite protein to target trimeric L9 antibody.  Nelson JAD, Garfinkle SE, Lin ZJ, Park J, Kim AJ, Bayruns K, McCanna ME, Konrath  KM, Agostino CJ, Kulp DW, John ARO, Pallesen J.  Currently approved vaccines for the prevention of malaria provide only partial  protection against disease, due to high variability in the quality of induced  antibodies. These vaccines present the unstructured central repeat region, as  well as the C-terminal domain, of the circumsporozoite protein ( Pf CSP) of the  malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (1). A recently discovered protective  monoclonal antibody, L9, recognizes three structured copies of the Pf CSP minor  repeat. Similarly to other highly potent anti-malarial antibodies, L9 relies on  critical homotypic interactions between antibodies for its high protective  efficacy (2, 3). Here, we report the design of immunogens scaffolding one copy  of Pf CSP's minor repeat capable of binding L9. To design immunogens capable of  presenting multiple, structure-based epitopes in one scaffold, we developed a  machine-learning-driven structural immunogen design pipeline, MESODID, tailored  to focus on multi-epitope vaccine targets. We use this pipeline to design  multiple scaffolds that present three copies of the Pf CSP minor repeat. A 3.6 Å  cryo-EM structure of our top design, minor repeat targeting immunogen (M-TIM),  demonstrates that M-TIM successfully orients three copies of L9, effectively  recapitulating its critical homotypic interactions. The wide prevalence of  repeated epitopes in key vaccine targets, such as HIV-1 Envelope, SARS-CoV-2  spike, and Influenza Hemagglutinin, suggests that MESODID will have broad  utility in creating immunogens that incorporate such epitopes, offering a new  powerful approach to developing vaccines against a range of challenging  infections, including malaria. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study, we present a machine learning driven,  structure-guided protein design pipeline built specifically for the design of  multi-epitope vaccine immunogens. We employ the pipeline here to design and  solve the cryo-EM structure of a de novo immunogen that binds and properly  orients three copies of the anti-malarial monoclonal antibody L9, producing a  promising next-generation malaria vaccine immunogen. This design pipeline could  be employed to design any number of structurally constrained multi-epitope  immunogens, as well as other proteins designed to bind multiple targets.

BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis, an invasive fungal infection caused by Mucorales, has  emerged as a significant concern in COVID-19 patients, particularly in regions  heavily affected by the pandemic. Liposomal Amphotericin B is the primary  treatment modality for mucormycosis; however, data on its efficacy and safety in  COVID-19-associated mucormycosis are limited. This prospective observational  study aimed to evaluate the management of mucormycosis in COVID-19 and  post-COVID patients treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B at a dedicated  COVID-19 hospital in IGIMS, Patna from Eastern India. Primary objectives were  the study of liposomal amphotericin for the initial treatment of mucormycosis  and treatment outcomes. The secondary objective was to study various  complications of Liposomal Amphotericin B therapy. METHODOLOGY: In total, 121 adult patients diagnosed with mucormycosis and either  active COVID-19 infection or in the post-COVID recovery phase were included in  the study. The treatment outcomes, complications, and factors influencing  patient prognosis were assessed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS  statistical software, including logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards  modelling. RESULTS: Most patients achieved resolution of mucormycosis infection (70.2%),  but the mortality rate was notable at 24.8%. Adverse events including  nephrotoxicity (20.7%), infusion-related reactions (12.4%), and electrolyte  imbalances (33.1%) were prevalent. Logistic regression analysis identified that  older age (p = 0.002), diabetes (p = 0.01), delayed treatment initiation (p =  0.001), higher doses of Amphotericin B (p = 0.04), and pre-existing renal  impairment (p = 0.01) were significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Cox  Proportional Hazards modelling showed a trend towards improved outcomes with  longer treatment duration (p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: This study provides added information into the management of  mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B. Despite  achieving a relatively high-resolution rate, the significant mortality and  complication rates underscore the challenges in managing this fungal infection.

INTRODUCTION: The global increase in life expectancy and quality of life has led  to a higher demand for surgical care among the older adults. Frailty, rather  than chronological age, has emerged as a critical predictor of poor surgical  outcomes. This paper discusses the adoption of the PDCA cycle in the successful  establishment of a nurse-led perioperative service focusing on frailty for older  adults undergoing elective major surgeries. METHODS: The nurse-led program was piloted in 2017 and formally established in  2018. It focuses on frailty assessment, multimodal prehabilitation, and Enhanced  Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in the perioperative phase. Data from April 2018  to March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients aged 65 and above  undergoing elective major surgeries were enrolled into the programme. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2023, 949 elderly patients were enrolled into the program.  The most common surgeries were colorectal (55.4 %) and hepatobiliary (29.1 %)  surgeries. Referral rates increased exponentially, except during the COVID-19  pandemic. There was a 28 % reduction in median post-operative length of stay  (LOS) from nine to five days. Post-operative complications and readmission rates  remained stable. Patient satisfaction to the programme is high, with 99.5 % of  patients feeling satisfied with the nurse-led service. DISCUSSION: This nurse-led program has effectively identified patients with  frailty, allowing for tailored perioperative care. The integration of  nursing-led assessments utilizing Edmonton Frail Scale and Comprehensive  Geriatric Assessment with nurse led multidisciplinary referrals contributed to  reduced LOS and high patient satisfaction. Despite stable complication and  readmission rates, the program's structured approach facilitated better  pre-surgical preparation and post-operative care. CONCLUSION: The nurse-led program has shown promising results in optimizing  elderly patients for surgery and improving perioperative outcomes while  enhancing and empowering the role of nurses.

OBJECTIVES: A disabling medical event, such as a hip fracture, can cause  psychological destabilisation and increase suicide risk. This study aimed to  estimate incident suicide ideation (SI) within 1 year after a hip fracture and  identify psychosocial predictors of SI and associations with functional  recovery. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted with data from a longitudinal study  of risk factors for late-life depression after hip fracture. Four hundred and  ninety-four patients with hip fracture and without prior clinical depression,  and a comparison sample of 102 healthy community-dwelling older adults, were  included in analyses. Participants were interviewed with the Montgomery-Asberg  Depression Rating Scale, which includes an item assessing SI at eight timepoints  after hip fracture. RESULTS: SI was endorsed by 14.8% (73) of patients versus 5.9% (6) healthy  controls during the year after hip fracture. Suicidal thoughts were commonly  passive and transient. Older age (OR = 1.04) and higher perceived stress  (OR = 2.07) uniquely predicted SI. Function was associated with SI immediately  after the fracture and 6-12 months later. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that there are vulnerable periods for SI after a  hip fracture, particularly for people who experience high stress. The  relationship between SI and function is strongest 6-12 months after a fracture.  © 2025 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society.

Multistate Markov model for household's food insecurity transitions and their  influencing predictors during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.  Waqo HW(1), Woldemedihn GM(1), Asfaw ZG(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Statistics Hawassa University, Hawassa, Ethiopia.

Food insecurity is one of the most widespread social problems that millions of  the world's people are experiencing worries. The problem has been rising,  particularly in Ethiopia, since 2020 due to Covid-19 with changing households'  food insecurity dynamics which is not clear yet. This study aimed to investigate  the dynamics of households' food insecurity transitions and assess the  associated covariates during Covid-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. The study used  Ethiopia-High Frequency Phone Survey longitudinal data set collected by World  Bank with the total of 13517 observations repeated over time. Multistate Markov  model was employed to model the paths of changing household's food insecurity  process and identify the influencing covariates of each transition. The result  indicated that out of households observed in food secure state initially at one  visit, 26.0% were observed in food insecure states. The corresponding values for  households that were initially at mild, moderate, and severe states were 68.6%,  88.3%, and 94.8% respectively. Once a household enters mild and moderate, his  incidence rate increases revealing that a household initially at severe food  insecure states experiences higher risk of staying as food insecure. Sex of  household head is significantly associated with food insecurity; with female  headed households are respectively 1.2345 and 1.1720 times more likely to enter  from food secure to mild and from mild to moderate states as compared to male  headed households. Households' residence, income loss, employment status, and  assistance provisions during Covid-19 were significant predictors of food  insecurity given that they were primarily at food secure and mild food insecure  states; but they lack the significance for households initially at moderate  state. The initial food insecurity state of households, time duration, and  varying effects of covariates are the crucial issues in predicting food  insecurity dynamics. Timely interventions are necessary for the effective  recovery of household's food insecurity.  Copyright: © 2025 Waqo et al.

PURPOSE: This longitudinal cohort study evaluates whether lifestyle and  psychosocial factors are associated with psychological resilience at two time  points of COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we investigated the mediating role of  perceived stress on these associations. METHODS: A total of 677 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults at increased  risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression  Scale (HADS). Based on the Reliable Change Index (RCI), HADS trajectories were  defined at two intervals: (1) pre-pandemic-confinement (follow-up = 2,28 ± 0,84  years); (2) confinement-post-confinement (follow-up = 1,49 ± 0,12 years). Then,  4 trajectory groups were defined: Psychological Resilience (n = 448, stable or  improve at both intervals), Descending (n = 84, stable/improve [interval  1]-worsen [interval 2]), Recovery (n = 59, worsening [interval 1], improvement  [interval 2] ) and Non-resilient (n = 86, worsening at both intervals). Logistic  regression models (LRM) were applied considering lifestyle (physical and leisure  activities, sleep) and psychosocial factors (social relationships and emotional  support) as predictors of psychological resilience trajectory (i.e., outcome) at  both intervals. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out to test the effect  of perceived stress on the relationships between the predictive factors and  psychological resilience. RESULTS: Our finding showed that most participants followed a psychological  resilient trajectory (66,1%). LRMs indicated that higher physical activity  level, a greater number of social interactions and longer sleep duration were  significantly associated with a psychological resilience trajectory both at  confinement and at the 1.5 years follow-up. Lastly, the mediation analyses  suggested that these factors influence psychological resilience through the  mitigation of perceived stress. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the role of physical activity, social  interactions and sleep quality to strengthen individuals' capacity to cope with  stress during prolonged crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These lifestyle  and psychological factors may be valuable targets for public health strategies  aimed to prevent mental health problems.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Respiratory COVID-19 post-acute sequelae (PASC) may persist for  extended periods following recovery. METHODS: Patients with PASC who were referred for Salus Per Aquam (SPA) therapy  were enrolled in the study. AIM: To categorize patients based on the presence of dyspnea and fatigue, with a  specific focus on obesity, chronic respiratory conditions, and predictors of  rehabilitation outcomes. RESULTS: From July-November 2021, 327 consecutive patients were enrolled at the  spa center. Among these, 31% had been previously hospitalized, 5% had required  noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Approximately one-third of the  cohort underwent DLCO testing, which was abnormal in 56.3% of cases. Patients  with impaired DLCO had significantly higher dyspnea rates compared to those with  normal DLCO (88.9% vs. 64.3%, p < 0.0001). Dyspneic patients were more likely to  have one or more comorbidities (p < 0.001), be obese (p = 0.005), and have a  history of chronic respiratory disease (p = 0.0009). Patients reporting fatigue  also had higher rates of dyspnea (91.2% vs. 61.5%, p < 0.0001), were more  frequently obese (p = 0.03), had more comorbidities (p = 0.02), and had a  greater history of hospitalization (p = 0.02). No improvement in dyspnea/fatigue  was observed post-SPA treatment among patients with DLCO impairment and obese.  However, patients with chronic respiratory conditions reported benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnea in PASC is complex and multifactorial. The findings suggest  that SPA rehabilitation may be particularly beneficial for alleviating fatigue  and enhancing overall well-being in selected subgroups of patients with PASC.

INTRODUCTION: Repair of mitochondrial damage seems pivotal for clinical recovery  and determining outcome in patients with critical COVID-19. However, reliable  biomarkers for non-invasively assessing mitochondrial repair in peripheral blood  of critically ill COVID-19 patients are currently lacking. Accordingly, we  sought to assess different surrogates of mitochondrial repair in peripheral  blood and correlate these measurements with clinical outcome in patients with  critical COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective multicentric cohort study, 88 critically ill  COVID-19 patients were enrolled across three German intensive care units. Gene  products of mitochondrial quality control (MFN2, PINK, TFAM, TFB2M) and the  mtDNA copy number were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Furthermore, the protein interactions between TFAM and TFB2M were quantified.  Patients were stratified regarding 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Transcript levels of the assessed mRNA markers of mitochondrial  quality control were not associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, more  than 10.7 protein interactions per cell were associated with a 74% 30-day  survival (37 out of 50), while 10.7 or fewer protein interactions per cell were  associated with a 32% 30-day survival (12 out of 38; p < 0.001). Furthermore,  multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed TFAM-TFB2M protein interaction as  an independent predictor for 30-day survival (HR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6 to 6.5; p <  0.001). DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that TFAM-TFB2M protein interactions,  identified as a novel biomarker, are strongly and independently associated with  30-day survival in critical COVID-19. Therefore, our data suggest a significant  impact of mitochondrial repair and quality control on clinical outcome in  critical COVID-19.

Biochemical Markers as Predictors of Coronavirus Disease-2019 Severity and  Intensive Care Unit Admission: A Retrospective Study in Saudi Arabia.  [Article in English, French; Abstract available in French from the publisher]  Hakami AM(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi  Arabia.  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging  infectious disease that can present with a wide range of symptoms and lead to  increased mortality by causing extreme respiratory failure, multiple organ  dysfunction, and death. Several biochemical markers have been proposed to  predicting the severity of COVID-19 and the consequent need for intensive care  unit (ICU) admission. This study provides insight into the role of different  laboratory parameters as a minimally invasive method in the prediction of  COVID-19 severity and the need for ICU admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all  patients with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for  COVID-19 who were hospitalized at the Ministry of Health South Al-Qunfudah  General Hospital between March and September 30, 2020. Laboratory parameters  (white blood cell [WBC] count, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and  erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Biochemical parameters were analyzed in 342 COVID-19 patients,  comprising 206 males and 136 females, with a mean age of 54 years. 97 patients  had critical illnesses, while 245 had noncritical illnesses. Critical illness  was defined as a condition that required intensive care or that resulted in  death. Noncritical illnesses did not require intensive care, resulting in  recovery. High LDH levels were significantly associated with critical COVID-19  cases compared with noncritical cases. WBC and lymphocyte parameter analyses  included 287 patients. Of these, 170 were male and 117 were female. These  analyses were conducted under severe conditions. The mean WBC count was  significantly higher in the critical cases than in the noncritical cases (11.15  vs. 6.96, P = 0.001). The mean lymphocyte count (LC) was significantly lower in  critical cases than in noncritical cases (1.11 vs. 1.89, P = 0.007). Age and sex  were not significantly associated with the disease severity or mortality. The  ESR parameter analysis included 161 patients. Based on the severity of the  condition, there were 63 women. These patients' critical outcomes included 15  patients, while the noncritical outcomes included 146 patients; however, it was  not significant to compare critical and noncritical patients, indicating that  these parameters cannot be used as biomarkers to predict the severity of  COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the effects of various biochemical markers on the  prognosis of COVID-19. Our findings concluded critical COVID-19 is associated  with significantly increased WBCs counts, LDH, and decreased LC. The ESR is not  a potential biomarker for predicting the severity of COVID-19. It is important  to note that the use of biochemical markers to assess severity has been reported  in the literature, and further research is required to validate their  effectiveness.  Publisher: Résumé Contexte et objectifs:La maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)  est une maladie infectieuse émergente qui peut se présenter avec une large gamme  de symptômes et entraîner une mortalité accrue en provoquant une insuffisance  respiratoire sévère, une défaillance multiviscérale et le décès. Plusieurs  marqueurs biochimiques ont été proposés pour prédire la gravité de la maladie et  la nécessité d’une admission en unité de soins intensifs (USI). Cette étude  explore le rôle de différents paramètres de laboratoire comme méthode peu  invasive pour prédire la gravité de la COVID-19 et le besoin d’admission en  USI.Méthodes:Cette étude observationnelle rétrospective a inclus tous les  patients ayant obtenu un résultat positif au test RT-PCR pour la COVID-19 et  hospitalisés au ministère de la Santé, à l’hôpital général d’Al-Qunfudah Sud,  entre mars et le 30 septembre 2020. Les niveaux des paramètres de laboratoire  (numération des globules blancs, numération des lymphocytes, LDH et VS) ont été  évalués. L’analyse des données a été réalisée avec SPSS version 23.Résultats:Les  paramètres biochimiques de 342 patients atteints de COVID-19, comprenant 206  hommes et 136 femmes, avec un âge moyen de 54 ans, ont été analysés. Parmi eux,  97 patients présentaient une maladie critique, tandis que 245 avaient une  maladie non critique. Une maladie critique était définie comme une condition  nécessitant des soins intensifs ou entraînant le décès. Les maladies non  critiques ne nécessitaient pas de soins intensifs et aboutissaient à une  guérison. Des niveaux élevés de LDH étaient significativement associés aux cas  critiques de COVID-19 par rapport aux cas non critiques. L’analyse des  paramètres des globules blancs (WBC) et des lymphocytes a inclus 287 patients,  dont 170 hommes et 117 femmes. Dans les cas graves, la numération moyenne des  globules blancs était significativement plus élevée dans les cas critiques que  dans les cas non critiques (11,15 vs 6,96, p=0,001). La numération moyenne des  lymphocytes était significativement plus faible dans les cas critiques que dans  les cas non critiques (1,11 vs 1,89, p=0,007). L’âge et le sexe n’étaient pas  significativement associés à la gravité de la maladie ou à la mortalité.  L’analyse de la vitesse de sédimentation des érythrocytes (VS) a inclus 161  patients. Parmi eux, 63 étaient des femmes. Les résultats critiques concernaient  15 patients, tandis que les résultats non critiques concernaient 146 patients.  Cependant, la comparaison entre les patients critiques et non critiques n’était  pas significative, indiquant que ces paramètres ne peuvent pas être utilisés  comme biomarqueurs pour prédire la gravité de la COVID-19.Conclusions:Nous avons  étudié les effets de divers marqueurs biochimiques sur le pronostic de la  COVID-19. Nos résultats montrent que les cas critiques de COVID-19 sont associés  à une augmentation significative de la numération des globules blancs (WBC), de  la lactate déshydrogénase (LDH) et à une diminution de la numération des  lymphocytes. La vitesse de sédimentation des érythrocytes (VS) n’est pas un  biomarqueur potentiel pour prédire la gravité de la COVID-19. Il est important  de noter que l’utilisation de marqueurs biochimiques pour évaluer la gravité de  la maladie a été rapportée dans la littérature, et des recherches  supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour valider leur efficacité.

BACKGROUND: Emergency medical service nurses worldwide face continuous  high-stress situations caused by critical incidents that can overwhelm them  emotionally and affect their daily functioning and sustainable employability.  Repeated exposure to these incidents negatively impacts their mental health. The  COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these issues, with high prevalence  rates of insomnia and fatigue among emergency medical service nurses serving as  key predictors of mental health problems. Until now little is known about the  mental consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS nurses. This study, the  first of its kind in the Netherlands, aims to assess the prevalence of insomnia,  fatigue, and symptoms of mental health problems and identify associated risk  factors. METHODS: A national cross-sectional study was conducted in the Netherlands in  spring 2022. Data were collected through an online survey among emergency  medical service nurses covering personal characteristics as well as validated  scales on insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder. RESULTS: Prevalence rates were 39.2% for insomnia, 32.5% for fatigue, 18.4% for  anxiety, 16.2% for depression and 10% for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Not  recovering from COVID-19 was linked to higher odds of fatigue, while living  alone was associated with insomnia. Working as an emergency medical dispatcher  and more work experience were linked to increased fatigue. Regional differences  in emergency medical services organizations and full recovery of COVID-19 showed  to result in lower odds of insomnia in ambulance professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia and fatigue are prevalent among emergency medical service  nurses. These conditions heighten the risk of severe mental health problems and  potential sickness leave. Further research is needed to explore factors  contributing to these issues and to develop targeted interventions supporting  professionals sustainability.

The pandemic period significantly impacted professional football, leading to  mandatory SARS-CoV-2 testing and quarantine. Our study aimed to examine the  factors influencing time of recovery after a positive test, including  return-to-training (RTT) and return-to-first-match (RTFM) of male football  players in a first-division Hungarian team between 8 May 2020 and 30 June 2022.  Infection was determined using mandatory RT-PCR testing 3 times per week, which  later decreased to 1 to 2 times per week, in 55 elite players. A  self-administered questionnaire was utilized based on the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services symptom list and modified with relevant factors of  return-to-play in football. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2-positive players in the  three consecutive years was 5.26; 21.43 and 45.71%. Mild symptoms were present  in test-positive players, completing the questionnaire (n = 31), predominantly  loss of smell and dry cough. Post-infection fatigue levels correlated with the  perceived performance decline. In players with precisely documented dates (n =  18), the average RTT was 18.7 days, while the RTFM was 67.3 days. Older players  returned to training faster than their younger counterparts and the RT-PCR Ct  number had a weak negative correlation with RTFM. Mental support was provided by  family and friends in 68% of the players. This study highlights the variability  in return-to-play timelines and the role of age, symptom severity and mental  help in recovery and emphasizes the need for individualized rehabilitation in  elite football.

Previous studies suggest that nursing diagnoses (NDs) could predict clinical  outcomes, such as mortality, among patients with non-communicable diseases.  However, evidence in patients with COVID-19 is still scarce. Objective: To  evaluate the association between NDs and COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized  patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 498 paper  clinical records of patients hospitalized for at least 72 h in the internal  medicine unit for COVID-19 from June to December 2020. The interest association  was assessed using logistic regression models. Results: NDs focused on COVID-19  pulmonary responses, such as impaired gas exchange (OR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.87,  4.95), impaired spontaneous ventilation (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.17, 6.21), or  ineffective airway clearance (OR = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.48, 4.12), were significant  predictors of mortality. NDs on COVID-19 extrapulmonary responses, such as risk  for unstable blood glucose level (OR = 2.45; 95% CI = 1.45, 4,15), risk for  impaired liver function (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.11, 3.63), hyperthermia (OR =  2.08; 95% CI = 1.29, 3.35), decreased cardiac output (OR = 2.95; 95% CI = 1.42,  6.11), or risk for shock (OR = 3.03; 95% CI = 1.28, 7.13), were associated with  a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Conversely, patients with NDs of fear  (OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.35, 0.89) and anxiety (OR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.77)  had a lower risk of death. Conclusions: NDs on pulmonary and extrapulmonary  responses to COVID-19 were associated with in-hospital mortality, suggesting  that they are indicators of the severity of these patients. Therefore, NDs may  help nursing staff identify individuals who require closer monitoring and guide  early interventions for their recovery.

OBJECTIVE: Muscle wasting in critically ill patients, particularly those with  prolonged hospitalization, poses a significant challenge to recovery and  long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize long-term muscle  wasting trajectories in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ARDS) due to COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis (AP), to evaluate correlations  between muscle wasting and patient outcomes, and to identify clinically feasible  thresholds that have the potential to enhance patient care strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A collective of 154 ICU patients (100 AP and 54 COVID-19  ARDS) with a minimum ICU stay of 10 days and at least three abdominal CT scans  were retrospectively analyzed. AI-driven segmentation of CT scans quantified  changes in psoas muscle area (PMA). A mixed model analysis was used to assess  the correlation between mortality and muscle wasting, Cox regression was applied  to identify potential predictors of survival. Muscle loss rates, survival  thresholds and outcome correlations were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: Muscle loss in ICU patients was most pronounced in the first two weeks,  peaking at -2.42% and - 2.39% psoas muscle area (PMA) loss per day in weeks 1  and 2, respectively, followed by a progressive decline. The median total PMA  loss was 48.3%, with significantly greater losses in non-survivors. Mixed model  analysis confirmed correlation of muscle wasting with mortality. Cox regression  identified visceral adipose tissue (VAT), sequential organ failure assessment  (SOFA) score and muscle wasting as significant risk factors, while increased  skeletal muscle area (SMA) was protective. ROC and Kaplan-Meier analyses showed  strong correlations between PMA loss thresholds and survival, with daily  loss > 4% predicting the worst survival (39.7%). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, This is the first study to highlight the  substantial progression of muscle wasting in prolonged hospitalized ICU  patients. The mortality-related thresholds for muscle wasting rates identified  in this study may provide a basis for clinical risk stratification. Future  research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore strategies  to mitigate muscle loss. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Electronic address: ib08@aub.edu.lb.  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) significantly impacts morbidity,  impairing quality of life (QoL) and mental health. This study assesses PCS  symptom prevalence, the impact of COVID-19 severity on QoL and mental health and  identifies predictors of impaired QoL among COVID-19 survivors in Lebanon. METHOD: ology: The study included adult COVID-19 survivors who recovered at  least 4 weeks before enrollment. Participants completed symptom questionnaires,  36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale  (HADS) at enrollment and during follow-up visits. PCS symptoms prevalence, SF-36  and HADS scores were compared across infection severity groups. Multivariate  linear regressions identified predictors of lower SF-36 scores. RESULTS: The study included 417 patients, with 50.1 % being male and an average  age of 48 years. Most patients (78 %) had mild COVID-19 and presented within 3  months of recovery (83 %). The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue  (54.3 %), dyspnea (47.5 %), cough (38.8 %), and palpitations (38.4 %). Dyspnea  was more prevalent in severe cases (71.4 %) than in mild and moderate ones.  Severe COVID-19 patients had significantly lower scores in physical function,  role limitations due to physical health, and body pain compared to the mild  group. Mild cases had higher abnormal HADS anxiety scores than moderate and  severe cases, with no differences in HADS depression scores. The main  independent predictors of impaired physical functioning and role limitations  were severe COVID-19, fatigue, and dyspnea. CONCLUSION: PCS severely impacts QoL and mental health, with impairment directly  linked to the severity of acute infection and the persistence of symptoms.  Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Middle-aged  and elderly patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD)  who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection may experience depressive symptoms  due to the physical and psychological impact of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and predictors of depressive symptoms  among the middle-aged and elderly with CVD who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2  infection in Wuhan, China, and to develop a prediction model for depressive  symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 462 former SARS-CoV-2  middle-aged and elderly patients with CVD in Jianghan District, Wuhan, China  from June 10 to July 25, 2021. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient  Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Potential predictors of depressive symptoms were  selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)  regression. A prediction model was developed by random forest (RF) and logistic  regression models and compared by the area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUROC). The discrimination, calibration, and practical  utility of the prediction model were evaluated by the receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis  (DCA). Bootstrap sampling was used for internal validation. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the participants was  35.93%. The prediction model included age, stethalgia after recovery, insomnia  after recovery, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, fatigue, and  perceived social support as predictors. The AUROC of the logistic regression  model was 0.909 (95%CI: 0.879 ~ 0.939), indicating good discrimination. The  calibration curve showed good calibration. The DCA showed that the prediction  model had a net benefit for a wide range of risk thresholds. The internal  validation confirmed the stability of the prediction model. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are common among middle-aged and elderly CVD  patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China. A  prediction model with satisfactory performance was developed to estimate the  risk of depressive symptoms among this population. Interventions targeting long  COVID symptoms and social support should be considered to prevent depressive  symptoms in CVD patients.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic significantly disrupted  health care delivery, leading to delays in diagnostic procedures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the factors associated with delays in  time from diagnostic examination to image-guided breast biopsies during the  prepandemic, shutdown, and postshutdown periods. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 4,415 examinations with a  BI-RADS 4 or 5 assessment recommending image-guided biopsy for 4,197 patients at  a multisite academic institution from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021.  Delays in biopsy were assessed across three periods: prepandemic (January 1,  2019, to February 29, 2020, n = 1,551), shutdown (March 1, 2020, to May 31,  2020, n = 170), and postshutdown (June 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, n =  2,694). Patient factors included age, race, ethnicity, personal or family  history of breast cancer, area deprivation index, employment, insurance, and  marital status. Clinical factors included BI-RADS assessment and biopsy  modality. t Tests, Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests, and univariate and multivariate  logistic regression analyses were performed to quantify and identify factors  associated with biopsy delay. RESULTS: The median time to biopsy from diagnostic examination significantly  increased between the prepandemic (11 days) and postshutdown (16 days) periods  (P < .001). Significant biopsy delays, defined as ≥30 days to biopsy, increased  between the prepandemic (9%) and postshutdown (12%) periods (P = .001). Compared  with the prepandemic period, same-day biopsies increased in the shutdown period  (from 8% to 24%, P < .001) due to institutional implementation of same-day  procedures during the shutdown, then sharply declined in the postshutdown period  (2%, P < .001). Biopsies were independently more likely to be delayed in the  postshutdown period compared with the prepandemic period on multivariate  analysis (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, P = .004). In addition to time period, patient  factors including age between 60 and 70 years (OR 1.5, P = .020) or ≥70 years  (OR 1.9, P = .002), Black (OR 1.6, P < .001) or Asian (OR 1.9, P = .003) race,  not having a personal history of breast cancer (OR 1.4, P = .018), being  unemployed (OR 1.5, P = .005) or uninsured (OR 2.7, P = .001), being unmarried  (OR 1.4, P = .004), and undergoing stereotactic (OR 1.3, P = .013) or MRI (OR  4.7, P < .001) biopsies were significant predictors of delay in the prepandemic  and postshutdown periods on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in breast biopsies increased between the prepandemic and  postshutdown periods. Significant delays were more prevalent among older, racial  minority, unemployed, uninsured, and unmarried patients during the study period,  with the postshutdown period independently predicting significant delays. CLINICAL IMPACT: These findings highlight the need for continued interventions  to mitigate the effects of health care disruptions, particularly for vulnerable  populations, to ensure timely breast cancer diagnoses during and in the recovery  period following future health care crises.

Predictors of nurses' work-related mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a  paired follow-up study.  Nagel C(1)(2), Nilsson K(1)(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. (2)Department of Health Sciences, Kristianstad University, Kristianstad, Sweden.  Nurses are essential pillars of society, providing care for the sick. It is  crucial for society to ensure that nurses have favorable working conditions, as  they face a heightened risk of negative psychological conditions such as  depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional exhaustion due to the demanding  nature of their work. The strain on healthcare staff, particularly during the  COVID-19 pandemic, has underscored these challenges. This study aimed to  identify predictors of work-related mental health issues in nurses' work  environments. In 2017, a questionnaire was distributed to 9,219 Swedish nurses,  with 4,962 responses received. The questionnaire was redistributed during the  pandemic in 2020, and 3,107 nurses responded. However, due to missing data and  some nurses previously reporting a mental health diagnosis, only 2,030  questionnaires were included in the study. Among these, 143 nurses reported  experiencing work-related mental health problems. The data was analyzed by  logistic regression analysis, and 6 out of the 24 statements investigated were  statistically significant (p < 0.05), i.e., there was a longitudinal association  between nurses' work situation and their mental health problems. The six  statements were ""I do not feel I get enough rest/recuperation between work  shifts"", ""The work pace in my daily work is too high"", ""I do not feel I have  enough support from my coworkers"", ""I do not experience joy in my daily work"",  ""I do not feel like my daily work is meaningful"", and ""I do not get enough  opportunities at work to utilize my skills and knowledge"". CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that work pace, recovery, support from  colleagues, joy, meaningfulness, and development opportunities at work are  particularly important for nurses' mental health. Actions in those areas are  needed for nurses to have a sustainable work situation.  © 2025 Nagel and Nilsson.

Routine Immunisation Coverage Shows Signs of Recovery at Global Level  Postpandemic, but Important Declines Persist in About 20% of Countries.  Evans B(1), Kaiser L(2), Keiser O(1), Jombart T(3).  Author information: (1)Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, 1202  Geneva, Switzerland. (2)Division of Infectious Diseases, Geneva University Hospitals, 1205 Geneva,  Switzerland.

Background/Objectives: Routine immunisation (RI) coverage declines during the  COVID-19 pandemic, from 2020 to 2022, are well-reported. With the declared end  to the Public Health Emergency of International Concern in May 2023, and the  cessation of most nonpharmaceutical interventions that were introduced to  prevent or minimise COVID-19 spread, we (I) assess whether routine immunisation  coverage has rebounded to the level of prepandemic trends and (II) seek to  identify factors that help predict whether country performance has exceeded,  maintained, or declined compared with expectations (based on time-series  forecasting). Methods: We quantified global and country-level routine  immunisation diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) coverage trends postpandemic  (2023) compared with prepandemic trends using time-series forecasting across 190  countries. We used discriminant analysis of principal components and random  forests to identify relevant predictors of country-level coverage performance,  including twenty-eight indicators of health system strength, health workforce,  country income, pandemic containment, economic and health policies, and  demographic aspects. Results: We show that mean global DTP third-dose coverage  levels remained on average 2.7% [95% confidence intervals: 1.1-4.3%] lower than  expected in 2023. However, once accounting for temporal demographic changes, we  find that this translated to the total number of immunised children almost  reverting to expected levels because of decreasing fertility reducing  global-level immunisation target populations. At the country level, notable  disruption remained in over thirty countries (16.8% of countries below  expectations, 81.6% within expected ranges, and 1.6% above expectations).  Neither predictive method performed well at identifying factors associated with  coverage disruptions. Conclusions: Despite the end of COVID-19 pandemic  measures, RI remains below expectations in about 20% of countries. No clear  drivers of this continued disruption were identified. Further research is  required to inform recovery efforts and prevent future epidemic and pandemic  disruptions to routine health services.

BACKGROUND: Despite global efforts to mitigate COVID-19 infection through  vaccination and therapeutic interventions, morbidity and mortality rates  continued at variable rates. Although mortality risk and clinical features of  COVID-19 are well-documented, recovery patterns and prognostic factors  post-admission remain inconclusive, particularly in resource-limited settings  like Ethiopia. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) aimed to estimate  the pooled incidence rate of recovery and predictors among hospitalized COVID-19  patients in Ethiopia. METHODS: We searched (N = 1,191) articles using Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline from PubMed/MEDLINE  (N = 755), Scopus (N = 137), Web of Science (N = 84), Science Direct (N = 148),  Cochran (N = 25), and Google Scholar searching (N = 42) from December 2019 to  February 2024. The data were extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and  exported to Stata TM version 17.0 for further analysis. The Article quality was  assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. The pooled incidence rate  of recovery was estimated using a weighted inverse variance random-effects  meta-regression. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the I2  statistic. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity tests were also conducted to  explore publication bias. This file is registered in international Prospero with  ID (CRD42024518569). RESULT: Sixteen (N = 16) published studies with 7,676 hospitalized COVID-19  patients were included in the final report. The mean age of participants ranged  from 29 (± 17) to 57.5 (± 3) years, with male patients constituting the largest  proportion of participants, 4,491(58.5%). During recovery screening,  6,304(82.21%) cases were discharged as improved, 159 (2.1%) attriters, and 818  (10.6%) died during inpatient treatment. The pooled incidence of recovery,  mortality, and attrition rates were found to be 82.32% (95% CI: 78.81-85.83;  I2 = 94.8%), 14.3% (I2 = 98.45%), and 2.7% (I2 = 81.34%), respectively.  Incidence of recovery rate varied across regions and epidemic phases, with the  highest rate observed in Addis Ababa (89.94%, I2 = 78.33%) and the lowest  reported in the Tigray region (59.7%, I2 = 0.0%). Across epidemic phases, the  recovery rate was 88.05% (I2 = 29.56%) in Phase II, 84.09% (I2 = 97.57%) in  Phase I, and 78.92% (I2 = 96.9%) in Phase III, respectively. Factors included  being aged 15-30 years (pooled OR = 2.01), male sex (pooled OR = 1.46), no  dyspnea (pooled OR = 2.4; I2 = 79%), and no baseline comorbidities (pooled  OR = 1.15; I2 = 89.3%) were predictors for recovery. CONCLUSION AND  RECOMMENDATION: In Ethiopia, more than eight out of ten hospitalized COVID-19  patients recovered after inpatient treatment. However, the incidence of recovery  rates varied significantly across epidemic phases, study settings, and regions.  Factors including younger age, male sex, no dyspnea (shortness of breathing),  and no underlying comorbidity heightened recovery. It is highly recommended  those inpatients cares should focus on high-risk groups (older adults) and  implement standardized treatment protocols in each study setting. Regions with  lower recovery rates need aid in logistical support and training for healthcare  providers.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Despite the presence of individual differences in the depressive symptom change  in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, most studies have investigated  population-level changes in depression during the first year of the pandemic.  This longitudinal repeated-measurement study obtained 39,259 observations from  4,361 adults assessed nine times over a 24-month period in Norway (March 2020 to  March 2022). Using a Latent Change Score Mixture Model to investigate  differential change patterns in depressive symptoms, five profiles were  identified. Most adults revealed a consistently resilient (42.52%) or  predominantly resilient pattern differentiated by an initial shock in  symptomatology (13.17%). Another group exhibited consistently high depressive  adversities (8.5%). One group showed mild deterioration with small increases in  depressive symptomatology compared to onset levels (29.04%), and a second strong  deterioration group exhibited clinically severe levels of gained symptoms over  time (6.77%). Both deteriorating depressive symptom change patterns predicted  the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis and treatment seeking at the end of the  study period. Together, the absence of a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis at  the onset of the pandemic and severe symptom increases during, combined with  reports of psychiatric treatment seeking and diagnosis at the end of the study  period, indicated that the strongly deteriorating subgroup represents an  additional and newly emerged group of adults struggling with depressive  problems. Factors related to general adverse change (lower education levels,  lone residence), initial shocks prior to recovery (frequent information seeking,  financial and occupational concerns), and resilience and recovery (older age,  being in a relationship, physical activity) were identified. Binge drinking and  belonging to an ethnic minority were influential predictors of the strongly  deteriorating group. All major change patterns in depressive symptoms occurred  during the first 3 months of the pandemic, suggesting this period represents a  window of sensitivity for the development of long-lasting depressive states  versus patterns of recovery and resilience. These findings call for increased  vigilance of psychiatric symptoms during the initial phases of infectious  disease outbreaks and highlight a specific target period for the implementation  of preventive measures.

INTRODUCTION: According to WHO long COVID is defined as a continuation or  development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection,  with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation. We  followed up patients after an episode of acute COVID-19 for 1 year after  hospital discharge from different parts of India. METHODS: This was a multi-centric study among patients ≥18 years hospitalized  with COVID-19, which recruited patients at 6 weeks after hospital discharge  (baseline). Quantitative data on demographics, pre-existing co-morbidities, risk  factors, signs and symptoms and hospital parameters during acute COVID-19  infection were noted at baseline. They were followed up and data collected  telephonically thereafter at 3-6, 6-9 and 9-12 months regarding self-reported  persistence of symptoms. A qualitative component included face to face in-depth  interviews to elicit information on perceived health problems, quality of life  and financial burden due to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 315 patients were enrolled, with the majority being males  (59.4%). The median age was 52 years (IQR 40, 63). The prevalence of long COVID  was 16.5%. At 6 weeks and 12 months, 35.2% and 25.9% of patients, reported more  than one new symptom that affected their quality of life. Shortness of breath  was common at each time point, persistent muscle pain and weakness waxed and  waned. Variables at 6 weeks post discharge (baseline) such as shortness of  breath (OR 2.22 CI 1.06-4.65, p = <0.05), cough (OR 6.93, CI 2.36-20.30, p =  <0.05), fatigue (OR 2.34, CI 1.05-5.23, p = <0.05), and weight loss (OR 2.90, CI  1.30-6.49, p = <0.05) were significantly associated with long COVID. CONCLUSION: We found that long COVID was noted in 16.5% patients who self  reported non - recovery at 1 year. Physical symptoms, mental health issues and  mobility were persistent in a significant number of patients following an  initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 infection. In 25.9% of patients more  than 1 symptom was reported at 1 year after COVID-19. We urgently need  therapeutic interventions which can improve the quality of life in these  patients.

(#)Contributed equally  OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the  Hospital-at-Home (HaH) program played a key role in expanding healthcare  capacity and managing COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aims to evaluate the  factors contributing to readmission from HaH to conventional hospitalization and  to apply classification algorithms that support discharge decisions from  conventional hospitalization to HaH. METHODS: Blood biomarkers (IL-6, Hs-TnT, CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer) were  collected from 871 patients transferred to HaH after conventional  hospitalization for COVID-19 at the Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol.  Of these, 840 patients completed their recovery without any complications, while  31 of them required readmission. Statistical tests were conducted to assess  differences in blood biomarkers between the first day of conventional  hospitalization and the first day of HaH, as well as between patients who  successfully completed HaH and those who were readmitted. Various classification  algorithms (bagged trees, KNN, LDA, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, and the  support vector machine [SVM]) were implemented to predict readmission, with  performance evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and  the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in IL-6, Hs-TnT, CRP (p < 0.001),  and ferritin (p < 0.01) between the first day of conventional hospitalization  and the first day of HaH for patients who were not readmitted. However, no  significant differences were found in patients who were readmitted. At HaH,  readmitted patients exhibited higher CRP and Hs-TnT values. Among the  classification algorithms, the SVM showed the best performance, achieving 85%  sensitivity, 87% specificity, 86% accuracy, 84% F1 score, and 71% MCC. CONCLUSION: Hs-TnT was a key predictor of readmission for COVID-19 patients  discharged to HaH. Classification algorithms can aid clinicians in making  informed decisions regarding patient transfers from conventional hospitalization  to HaH.

However, the management of most  viral infection-associated diseases remains primarily supportive. The recent  COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need for a deeper understanding of  RVIs to improve patient outcomes and develop effective treatment strategies. The  Understanding Infection, Viral Exacerbation and Respiratory Symptoms at  Admission-Longitudinal Study is an observational study which addresses this need  by investigating the heterogeneity of RVIs in hospitalised adults, aiming to  identify clinical and biological predictors of adverse outcomes. This study aims  to bridge critical knowledge gaps in the clinical course and the economic impact  of RVIs by characterising the phenotypic diversity of these infections and their  recovery patterns following hospital admission and thus assisting with the  optimal design of future interventional studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective longitudinal observational study (V.6, 20  September 2023) will be conducted across multiple UK secondary care sites from  August 2022 onwards, with an aim to enrol 1000 participants testing positive for  RVI. Adults admitted with respiratory symptoms who test positive for RVIs via  the BioFire® FilmArray® System or other validated diagnostic PCR tests will be  enrolled. The data collected include patient demographics, clinical history,  comorbidities and symptoms experienced prior to, during and after  hospitalisation with follow-up after discharge at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 26.  In addition, biological samples are collected at multiple time points during the  hospital stay. The primary endpoints are to study the impact of different RVIs  and identify predictors of disease progression and length of stay. Secondary  endpoints include time to recovery and healthcare cost. Exploratory endpoints  focus on biomarker profiles associated with virus type and clinical outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol received ethical approval from the  relevant committees (English Ethics Reference Number: 22/WM/0119; Scottish  Ethics Reference Number: 22-SS-0101, 20/09/2023). For patients who lack the  capacity to consent, the study complies with the Mental Capacity Act 2005, using  a consultee process where a family member, carer or an independent clinician may  provide assent on behalf of the patient. Data from all the study centres will be  analysed together and disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference  presentations and workshops. The study group will ensure that participants and  their families are informed of the study findings promptly and in an accessible  format.

(2)Department of Paediatrics, State University of Campinas (Unicamp), Campinas,  SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.  BACKGROUND: Olfactory training is the most widely recommended treatment for  smell loss; however, there are no randomised placebo-controlled trials  evaluating its effectiveness in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of  isolated training and factors associated to olfactory recovery. METHODS: This is a prospective randomised double-blind controlled trial, using  standard olfactory training (OT) and placebo (PB) in COVID-19 patients  experiencing smell loss. They were followed up for 180 days and assessed with  the Connecticut olfactory test (CCCRC) and with subjective methods on a monthly  basis. RESULTS: A total of 123 participants completed follow-up: 68 in the OT group and  55 in the PB group. Overall, 84.5% achieved normosmia, with full recovery (FR)  significantly higher in PB. At baseline, OT had lower olfactory scores and  higher corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis showed no significant  differences in outcomes between groups. Baseline olfactory test scores were the  strongest predictors of recovery. Exploratory analyses stratified participants  by time to treatment initiation (early < 30 days; late > 30 days), showing a 58%  higher chance of FR in the early group for similar CCCRC scores, regardless of  management type. CONCLUSIONS: OT is not superior to PB for treating COVID-19-related smell loss.  Better results of first evaluation indicate great chance of full recovery and  the use of systemic corticosteroid, in persistent olfactory loss, has not  affected outcome.

Immunotherapy with nebulized pattern recognition receptor agonists restores  severe immune paralysis and improves outcomes in mice with influenza-associated  pulmonary aspergillosis.

(2)Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The  University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.  Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a potentially deadly  superinfection in patients with influenza pneumonia, especially those with  severe disease, underlying immunosuppression, corticosteroid therapy, or  requiring intensive care support. Given the high mortality of IAPA, adjunct  immunomodulatory strategies remain a critical unmet need. Previously, the  desensitization of pattern recognition pathways has been described as a hallmark  of IAPA pathogenesis and a predictor of mortality in IAPA patients. Therefore,  we studied the impact of nebulized Toll-like receptor 2/6/9 agonists Pam2 CSK4  (Pam2) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on infection outcomes and pulmonary  immunopathology in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed murine IAPA model. Mice  with IAPA receiving mock therapy showed rapidly progressing disease and a  paralyzed immune response to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection.  Nebulized Pam2ODN was well tolerated and significantly prolonged event-free  survival. Specifically, dual-dose Pam2ODN therapy before and after A. fumigatus  infection led to 81% survival and full recovery of all survivors. Additionally,  transcriptional analysis of lung tissue homogenates revealed induction of  pattern recognition receptor signaling and several key effector cytokine  pathways after Pam2ODN therapy. Moreover, transcriptional and flow cytometric  analyses suggested increased frequencies of macrophages, natural killer cells,  and T cells in the lungs of Pam2ODN-treated mice. Collectively, immunomodulatory  treatment with nebulized Pam2ODN strongly improved morbidity and mortality  outcomes and alleviated paralyzed antifungal immunity in an otherwise lethal  IAPA model. These findings suggest that Pam2ODN might be a promising candidate  for locally delivered immunomodulatory therapy to improve outcomes of  virus-associated mold infections such as IAPA.IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic  has highlighted the significant healthcare burden, morbidity, and mortality  caused by secondary fungal pneumonias. Given the heightened prevalence of severe  viral pneumonias, such as influenza, and poor outcomes of secondary mold  pneumonias, adjunct immunotherapies are needed to prevent and treat secondary  infections. We herein demonstrate severely paralyzed immunity to secondary  Aspergillus fumigatus infection in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model  of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), partially due to  dysregulated pathogen-sensing pathways. To overcome immune paralysis and IAPA  progression, we used a dyad of nebulized immunomodulators (Toll-like receptor  agonists). Nebulized immunotherapy significantly improved morbidity and  mortality compared to mock therapy, increased frequencies of mature mononuclear  phagocytes and natural killer cells in the lung, and stimulated antimicrobial  signaling.

Objectives: Prediction of lung function deficits following pulmonary infection  is challenging and suffers from inaccuracy. We sought to develop  machine-learning models for prediction of post-inflammatory lung changes based  on COVID-19 recovery data. Methods: In the prospective CovILD study (n = 420  longitudinal observations from n = 140 COVID-19 survivors), data on lung  function testing (LFT), chest CT including severity scoring by a human  radiologist and density measurement by artificial intelligence, demography, and  persistent symptoms were collected. This information was used to develop models  of numeric readouts and abnormalities of LFT with four machine learning  algorithms (Random Forest, gradient boosted machines, neural network, and  support vector machines). Results: Reduced DLCO (diffusion capacity for carbon  monoxide <80% of reference) was found in 94 (22%) observations. Those  observations were modeled with a cross-validated accuracy of 82-85%, AUC of  0.87-0.9, and Cohen's κ of 0.45-0.5. No reliable models could be established for  FEV1 or FVC. For DLCO as a continuous variable, three machine learning  algorithms yielded meaningful models with cross-validated mean absolute errors  of 11.6-12.5% and R2 of 0.26-0.34. CT-derived features such as opacity, high  opacity, and CT severity score were among the most influential predictors of  DLCO impairment. Conclusions: Multi-parameter machine learning trained with  demographic, clinical, and artificial intelligence chest CT data reliably and  reproducibly predicts LFT deficits and outperforms single markers of lung  pathology and human radiologist's assessment. It may improve diagnostic and  foster personalized treatment.  DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics15060783 PMCID: PMC11941013 PMID: 40150125  Conflict of interest statement: P.T.

Background Patients with hematological malignancies (HMs), particularly those  who have undergone bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HSCT), are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality due to  immunosuppression. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these vulnerabilities in HM  patients, although comprehensive data specifically on HSCT recipients are  limited. Objective This study investigated the clinical and demographic profiles  of HSCT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. We also identified  factors associated with in-hospital mortality in HSCT patients. Methods We  conducted a nationwide, retrospective analysis using data from the Spanish  National Health System. We included hospitalized patients with HMs and COVID-19  infection from 2020 to 2022. We used descriptive statistics, multivariate  logistic regression, and survival analyses to assess predictors of mortality.  Results In total, 35,648 patients with HMs were included, of whom 2,324 (6.5%)  had undergone HSCT. The in-hospital mortality rate for HSCT recipients was 13%,  lower than the 20% observed in non-HSCT patients. Older age, dementia, acute  leukemia, and solid tumors were independently associated with increased  mortality. In spite of their immunosuppressed state, HSCT recipients experienced  relatively favorable outcomes, suggesting partial immune recovery following  transplantation. Conclusions HSCT recipients with COVID-19 present different  clinical characteristics and mortality risks than non-recipients. These findings  indicate the need for specific management strategies for this vulnerable  population. Further research is needed to explore immunological recovery and the  transplant-specific factors that may influence COVID-19 outcomes.  © 2025. The Author(s).

This study investigates the impact of immunological and clinical factors on  COVID-19 outcomes among unvaccinated individuals. A cohort of 42 unvaccinated  patients admitted to an intensive care unit was analyzed, focusing on age,  comorbidities, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein antibody levels (IgG) to assess their influence on hospital stay  duration, recovery time, complications, and mortality rates. The findings  revealed that advanced age, cardiovascular disease, and elevated  pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly heightened the risks of severe  complications and mortality. Conversely, low IgG levels correlated with  prolonged hospital stays and slower recovery. Multivariate analysis identified  high IL-6 and TNF-α levels as strong predictors of adverse outcomes. This  research emphasizes the need for the early monitoring of cytokines and targeted  management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, especially among  high-risk unvaccinated populations.

Survey and Analysis of Mental Health among Otolaryngology Nurses Following the  Conclusion of COVID-19 Prevention and Control Measures.  Yang X(1), Yu R(1), Zhao H(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, West China Hospital,  Sichuan University/West China School of Nursing, Sichuan University, Chengdu,  Sichuan, China.  Aims/Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed unique  pressures on healthcare workers, especially nurses. This study examines the  factors influencing mental health, stress perception, and burnout among  otolaryngology nurses after the cessation of COVID-19 prevention and control.  Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 otolaryngology nurses in  Sichuan province from 20 January to 28 January, 2023. Data were collected using  a general information questionnaire, the Nurse Workplace Mental Health  Questionnaire, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS-14), and the Maslach  Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). Statistical analyses included the  Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation analysis, and multiple linear  regression to identify significant factors and relationships within the dataset.  Results Of the 220 questionnaires distributed, 218 were valid, yielding a  recovery rate of 99.09%. The cohort included 3 males (mean age: 34.67 ± 12.39)  and 215 females (mean age: 35.63 ± 9.27). The average mental health score was  128.10 ± 21.29, indicating a moderate level of psychological well-being. The  CPSS-14 average score was 37.42 ± 7.27, reflecting moderate stress, while MBI-GS  scores highlighted varying levels of burnout, especially in emotional exhaustion  (median = 10.00). The Kruskal-Wallis test identified significant factors  affecting mental health, stress, and burnout, including family support, COVID-19  testing status, staffing adequacy, frequency of caring for critically ill  patients, teamwork satisfaction, job satisfaction, and resignation plans (p <  0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations  between mental health and stress (r = -0.525) and total burnout scores (r =  -0.646; p < 0.01). Multiple linear regression identified emotional exhaustion (β  = -0.922), low personal accomplishment (β = -0.623), and inadequate staffing (β  = -2.769) as significant negative predictors of mental health, while teamwork  satisfaction (β = 5.516) and job satisfaction (β = 5.032) were positively  associated with improved mental health (p < 0.01). Conclusion Otolaryngology  nurses experience notable mental health challenges in the post-pandemic era,  driven by stress and burnout. Addressing staffing shortages, fostering teamwork,  and enhancing job satisfaction are critical strategies to improve their  psychological well-being.

(3)Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Postgraduate Institute of Medical  Education and Research Chandigarh India.  AIMS: Patients with cirrhosis are susceptible to decompensation events,  including ascites, variceal bleeding (VB), hepatic encephalopathy, or death  after COVID-19 infection. Patients may experience post-COVID condition (PCC)  with multisystem involvement that persists for at least 2 months. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 between January 2021  and January 2023 were assessed for decompensation events and mortality and  compared to a propensity-matched cohort of cirrhosis and non-COVID-19 sepsis.  Both groups were followed for outcomes over 1 year. RESULTS: Of 252 patients with Cirrhosis+ COVID-19 (73% men, aged  48.9 ± 13.7 years, 31%-diabetes, 44%-hypertension, 35%-alcohol-associated,  34.5%-metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease; MASLD), 72  (28.6%) died in hospital and 180 (71.4%) recovered, similar to Cirrhosis+  non-COVID-sepsis (58/214, 27.1%). Finally,60 (33.3%) met criteria for PCC, 19  (10.5%) had no post COVID-19 sequelae and 101 (56.1%) patients died (N = 45) or  were lost to follow up (N = 56). Late Mortality was higher in Cirrhosis+  COVID-19 than non-COVID-sepsis (56.1% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.026). Patients with PCC  were aged 47.6 years, 63.3%-men, Charlson Comorbidity Index > 4 (51.7%),  45%-diabetes, 56.7%-hypertension, with 33.3%, 23.3%, and 43.3% in  Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A, B and C, respectively. PCC symptoms included  persistent dyspnea (34, 43%), cognitive impairment (20, 25.3%), and anxiety (47,  59.4%). On multivariable analysis, predictors of the development of PCC were  baseline MELDNa (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.17, p < 0.001) and age (HR 0.9, 95% CI:  0.91-0.99, p = 0.012). Predictors of mortality following COVID-19 recovery were  MELDNa (HR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.008), age (HR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5,  p = 0.002) and hypertension (HR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.07-2.49, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with long-term mortality in cirrhosis even  after recovery from respiratory infection. Long COVID is seen in a third of  COVID-19 survivors in patients with cirrhosis.  © 2025 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to implement a multi-state risk prediction model to  predict the progression of COVID-19 cases among hospitalized patients in  Kurdistan province by analyzing hospital care data. METHODS: This retrospective analysis consisted of data from 17,286 patients  admitted to hospitals with COVID-19 from March 23, 2019, to December 19, 2021,  in various areas in the Kurdistan province. A multi-state prediction model was  used to show that each transition is predicted by a different set of variables.  These variables include underlying diseases (like diabetes, hypertension, etc.)  and sociodemographic information (like sex and age). Model aims to predict the  likelihood of recovery, the need for critical care intervention (e.g., transfer  to isolation units or the ICU), or exits from the hospitalization course. We  performed the statistical analysis using R software and the mstate package. RESULTS: Of the hospitalized patients studied, 5.6% died of the disease, 6.6%  were admitted to ICUs, and 38.72% were treated in isolation units. Mortality  rates in general wards, isolation units, and the ICU were 3.48%, 4.56%, and  26.6%, respectively. Significant predictors for ICU admission include age over  60 years (HR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.37-1.55), kidney-related conditions (HR: 2.19, 95%  CI 1.65-2.91), cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.46-1.94), lung  disease (HR: 1.89,‏95% CI 1.43-2.05), and cancer (HR: 2.46,‏95% CI 1.77-3.41).  The likelihood of in-hospital death is significantly increased by age over 60  years (HR: 2.40, 95% CI 2.09-2.76), diabetes (HR: 1.97, 95% CI 1.45-2.68), high  blood pressure (HR: 2.30, 95% CI 1.78-2.97), and history of heart disease (HR:  3.01, 95% CI 2.29-3.95). CONCLUSION: The model helps the provider and policymakers to make an informed  decision depending on patient management and resource allocation within the  health care systems.  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical  Sciences 2025.

BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) represent a  significant challenge in patient care, with symptoms persisting beyond three  month's post-recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of PASC at one  year post-COVID-19 and identify predictive biomarkers and comorbidities for  effective risk stratification. METHODS: A cohort of 120 adult patients, including 50 intensive care and 70  non-intensive care patients, was followed up at two weeks, six weeks, and  one-year post-discharge using structured questionnaires. The study integrated  comorbidities and laboratory biomarkers to forecast the risk for PASC. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 56 years, with 40% having moderate  to severe comorbidities. A year post-recovery, 32.8% exhibited post COVID-19  conditions. The most common symptoms were constitutional (16%), respiratory  (8.4%), and neuropsychiatric (2.5%). Bayesian network analysis indicated  significant correlations between constitutional symptoms, rehospitalisation, and  biomarkers including C-reactive protein, lactate-dehydrogenase, ferritin, and  albumin. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prolonged impact of PASC, one-year post  infection. It highlights the role of specific biomarkers such as C-reactive  protein, lactate-dehydrogenase, ferritin, and albumin in tailoring individual  patient care by advancing understanding in post-COVID-19 symptoms prediction.  Our findings support the need for further research to refine these insights,  which are pivotal for the ongoing care of patients in the aftermath of COVID-19.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Several biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin,  D-dimer, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), are established predictors of disease  severity and respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this randomised clinical study, we evaluated the efficiency of the  combination of 2 variants' AFO-202 and N-163 strains of Aureobasidium pullulans  produced 1,3-1,6 β-glucans in comparison with the control arm on these  biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Forty RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were divided into 2 groups:  control (n = 22) and standard treatment; ii. (n = 18) - Standard treatment +  combination of AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans for 15 days. RESULTS: IL-6 levels significantly decreased in the treatment group on day 7 (P  = 0.03) but not by day 15 (P = 0.30). CRP levels in the treatment group  decreased at day 7 (5.53 ± 8.21 mg/L) compared to baseline but showed no  significant difference from the control group (4.91 ± 12.54 mg/L, P = 0.98). At  day 15, CRP levels remained lower in the treatment group (5.42 ± 10.41 mg/L) but  increased in the control group (14.0 ± 37.16 mg/L), with no significant  difference (P = 0.52). Ferritin levels dropped significantly in the treatment  group by day 15 (from 560.58 ± 537.30 ng/mL to 127.51 ± 215.91 ng/mL) but  increased in the control (P = 0.98). D-dimer levels decreased in the treatment  group by day 15 but were not significantly different from controls (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that while co-supplementation with AFO-202  and N-163 beta-glucans led to improvement in CRP, ferritin, and IL-6 levels in  COVID-19 patients, only the reduction in IL-6 levels on day 7 reached  statistical significance. Further long-term multicentric clinical research is  warranted to validate the potential of these supplements as treatment adjuncts,  for addressing inflammation in COVID-19, especially in vulnerable populations  infected with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.  © The Author(s) 2025.

Yılmaz M(1), Mirzaoğlu Ç(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, Elazığ Fethi Sekin City Hospital, University of  Health Sciences, 23280 Elazığ, Turkey.  Background: Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a non-invasive technique that can be  used to evaluate autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and cardiac arrhythmia.  The objective of this study is to investigate whether COVID-19 can lead to  long-term blunted HRT following recovery. Methods: This retrospective cohort  study included 253 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19, referred to  as the recovered COVID-19 group, along with 315 healthy participants who had no  history of the virus. The recovered COVID-19 group was categorized into three  subgroups based on their chest CT severity scores. The HRT analyses were  obtained from a 24-h electrocardiography-Holter recording. Results: This study  revealed that the HRT onset value was elevated in the recovered COVID-19 group,  while the HRT slope value showed a significant decrease when compared to the  control group. Correlation analyses indicated a positive relationship between  the chest CT severity score and HRT onset, whereas a negative correlation was  observed between the chest CT severity score and HRT slope. Regression analyses  identified recovery from severe COVID-19, chest CT severity score, hypertension  (HT), and smoking as independent predictors of both abnormal HRT onset and the  existence of an abnormal HRT slope. Conclusions: Individuals who have recovered  from severe COVID-19 are expected to encounter a permanent blunting of HRT,  which is regarded as a significant indicator of an increased risk of ventricular  arrhythmias and impaired autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Recovered  severe COVID-19 individuals should be carefully evaluated for HRT with 24-h  ECG-Holter.

Continuous Heart Rate Recovery Monitoring with ECG Signals from Wearables:  Identifying Risk Groups in the General Population.  Dogan A, Bishnoi A, Sowers RB, Hernandez ME.  Heart rate recovery (HRR) is a critical indicator of cardiovascular fitness and  autonomic nervous system function, reflecting the balance between sympathetic  and parasympathetic activity. Slower HRR is often linked to cardiovascular and  metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential for identifying high-risk  individuals. In this study, we developed a feature engineering approach  integrated to wearable device data to classify individuals into high-risk  (slower HRR) and low-risk (faster HRR) groups. Data were collected from 38  participants (aged 20 to 76 years, 55.26% women) during treadmill trial, with  ECG signals recorded using a smart shirt. Participants with an HRR equal to 28  beats per minute or below were classified as high-risk. Using machine learning  classifiers, our approach achieved an area under the curve (AUC) score of 86%  with Support Vector Classifier (SVC), demonstrating the feasibility of  continuous heart health monitoring via wearable devices. Interestingly, age did  not emerge as a significant predictor of HRR in our analysis, possibly due to  the impact of lifestyle changes during the lockdown policy of COVID-19 era. This  method holds promise for improving cardiovascular health monitoring  accessibility and could support physicians in risk assessment and clinical  decision-making.

Serious adverse events following immunization and predictors of mortality  associated with COVID-19 vaccination in India: a secondary data analysis of  nationwide causality assessments.  Rajan AK(1), Bashar MA(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Community and Family Medicine, All India Institute of Medical  Sciences, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. (2)Department of Community and Family Medicine, All India Institute of Medical  Sciences, Room No. 229, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh 273008, India.  BACKGROUND: Vaccines against COVID-19 were viewed as a way out to the ongoing  pandemic and were given the emergency use authorization in India to initiate  mass vaccination in January 2021. This study aimed to investigate the serious  adverse events following immunizations (AEFIs) reported for COVID-19 vaccines  and to identify predictors of mortality among these cases from India. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted on the causality assessment  reports for the 2708 serious AEFIs published by the National AEFI Committee  under the Immunization Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,  Government of India. The analysis included all 21 reports published up until May  2023. The primary outcome variable analyzed was the survival/death status of  each AEFI case, with various covariates from the published documents considered  in the analysis. RESULTS: The majority of the serious AEFIs assessed were either coincidental  (1220, 45%) or undetermined/unclassifiable (781, 28.8%). The majority of the  serious AEFIs were reported among recipients of Covishield (1891, 69.8%)  followed by Covaxin (347, 12.8%). Among these, 1114 (42.1%) died while the  remaining 1594 (58.9%) were hospitalized and recovered. Systematically, AEFIs  involving the cardiovascular system (696, 31.3%) were the most common, followed  by those affecting the respiratory system (288, 13%) and neuropsychiatric system  (295, 13.3%) which had a significant association with age (p < 0.001) and gender  (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, females (p = 0.001), younger age groups  (p < 0.001), AEFIs whose causality was determined and classified (p < 0.001),  AEFI involving gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric system (p < 0.001), AEFIs  reported from North and Western India (p = 0.001) and those occurring during the  winter season (p < 0.05) had significantly lower odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: Among the cohort of serious AEFIs reported, older age, male sex,  undetermined or unclassifiable causality classification, and involvement of the  cardiovascular system were associated with significantly higher odds of  mortality and require close monitoring following vaccination.  Plain Language Summary: Understanding serious side effects from COVID-19  vaccines in India: key findings and risks COVID-19 vaccines were introduced in  India in January 2021 to help control the pandemic. This study looked at serious  side effects reported from these vaccines to see which were most common and what  factors might predict serious outcomes, including death. The research analyzed  data from 2708 serious side effect reports reviewed by the National AEFI  Committee in India up to May 2023. The study found that many serious side  effects were either coincidental (45%) or unclassifiable (29%). Most of these  reports came from people who had received the Covishield vaccine (70%), with  fewer from those who got Covaxin (13%). Out of the serious side effects  reported, 42% resulted in death, while 59% led to hospitalization but recovery.  The most frequent side effects affected the heart (31%), followed by the  respiratory system (13%) and the nervous system (13%). Age and gender were  important factors, with older adults and males showing higher risks of severe  outcomes. The study also found that females, younger people, and those with  certain types of side effects had lower odds of dying. Additionally, serious  side effects reported in northern and western India and during winter had  different patterns compared to other regions and times. Overall, the study  highlights that older age, male sex, unclassified side effects, and those  involving the cardiovascular system are associated with higher mortality rates.  It underscores the need for careful monitoring of individuals who experience  serious side effects after vaccination, especially those at higher risk.  © The Author(s), 2025.

Altinsoy C(1)(2), Dikmen D(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hacettepe  University, 06230 Ankara, Turkey. (2)Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Recep  Tayyip Erdogan University, 53020 Rize, Turkey.  Background and Objectives: Brain fog, characterized by cognitive difficulties  such as memory impairment, lack of focus, and mental fatigue, is a common  symptom reported during recovery from COVID-19, particularly in long COVID  cases. This study explores potential triggers such as sleep quality, mood, and  gastrointestinal health and examines the link between adherence to the MIND diet  and brain fog severity. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was  conducted between 1 July and 15 December 2022. The questionnaire assessed brain  fog symptoms, dietary habits, sleep quality, mood, and gastrointestinal  symptoms. Linear regression analysis examined the relationships between brain  fog symptoms, demographic factors, sleep quality, MIND diet adherence, and  gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: Brain Fog Scale (BFS) scores were  significantly higher in individuals who had COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and even higher  in those with reinfection. Women had higher BFS and Brain Fog Severity Score  (BFSS), MIND Diet, The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Brief Mood  Introspection Scale (BMIS) Pleasant-Unpleasant scores (p < 0.05). BFS and BFSS  were positively correlated with GSRS (p < 0.05), while no correlation was found  with MIND diet adherence. A negative correlation was observed between BFS and  Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) (p < 0.05), but this was not significant in regression  (p = 0.367). GSRS, Pleasant-Unpleasant Dimension, and Arousal-Calm Dimension  were significant predictors of BFS (R = 0.599, R2 = 0.358, p < 0.01).  Conclusions: This study identifies being female as a risk factor for brain fog  symptoms, with women reporting higher BFS and BFSS scores. While sleep quality  showed a negative correlation with brain fog symptoms, this relationship was not  significant in the regression model, suggesting that other factors, such as mood  and gastrointestinal symptoms, may play a more dominant role. However, adherence  to the MIND diet showed no significant relationship with brain fog symptoms.  These findings suggest that addressing mood and gastrointestinal health may be  key to managing brain fog in long COVID.

(2)Slingedael Korsakoff Center, Lelie Care Group, 3086 EZ Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.  BACKGROUND: Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE), a neurological disorder often linked  to alcohol use, can also occur under non-alcoholic conditions, including in  pediatric populations. METHODS: This systematic review examines 88 pediatric WE cases reported over the  past 30 years, encompassing diverse etiologies such as cancer (25 cases),  gastrointestinal diseases (19), malnutrition (17), psychiatric disorders (13),  obesity surgery (5), renal disease (4), COVID-19 (2), PICU complications (1),  hyperemesis gravidarum (1), and a genetic mutation (1). RESULTS: Prodromal symptoms included nausea (60%) and vomiting (55%). In total,  37% of the patients received parenteral nutrition without thiamine before WE  diagnosis, often progressing to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). Key findings  revealed the classic triad of WKS, eye movement disorders (80%), mental status  changes (75%), and ataxia (63%), with MRI demonstrating high diagnostic  sensitivity (85%). Treatment varied widely; higher parenteral thiamine doses  correlated with faster recovery and better outcomes, while insufficient dosages  led to adverse effects. Full remission was achieved in 61% of cases, with  improved outcomes in more recent reports due to refined dosing protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of early recognition of  nausea and vomiting as predictors of pediatric WE and the critical need to  incorporate thiamine in parenteral nutrition for children. Optimal dosing  remains vital for recovery, particularly in severe cases.

(2)School of Medicine, University of Split, 21000 Split, Croatia. (3)Faculty of Humanities and Social Studies, University of Split, 21000 Split,  Croatia.  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, but the experiences  gained during its course can serve as a framework for preventive actions in  future crises. The main objectives were to examine the predictors of loneliness  in older adults during the pandemic and to explore the mediating effects of  emotional stability between pandemic-specific stressors and loneliness. To  achieve the set objectives, we developed a questionnaire to measure  pandemic-specific stressors in older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional research design was used. A total of 578 participants  of both genders (38.9% male, 61.1% female) aged 65 and above (M = 74.09, SD =  6.72) participated in this study. The self-reported measures used included the  following: The Ten-Item Personality Inventory, The Revised Loneliness Scale, The  Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation, and The Pandemic-Specific Stressors  Questionnaire for Older Adults. RESULTS: Using exploratory factor analysis, two factors were extracted,  providing evidence of face and convergent validity, together explaining 71.3% of  the variance. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good  model fit. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated the greatest contribution  of the psychological factors to loneliness in older adults during the pandemic,  while marital status and pandemic-specific stressors had a minor but still  significant impact. Mediation analysis revealed that emotional stability  mediated the association between social distancing experiences and loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: In future global pandemics, it is necessary to pay full attention  to psychological factors to preserve the mental health of older people. The  newly-constructed questionnaire identifies pandemic-specific stressors in older  adults, aiding their mitigation and easing recovery from the pandemic crisis.

(2)Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.  BACKGROUND: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis can  be a life-threatening condition, characterized by necrotizing inflammation of  small blood vessels. Major organ involvement, most commonly kidney and lung  disease, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Intensive early  immunosuppressive therapy is the cornerstone of management and has transformed  ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) into a chronic relapsing condition. Remission  induction with tapering glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or  rituximab is the standard of care for severe disease. Avacopan, an oral C5aR1  antagonist, has been approved for remission induction and helps minimize  glucocorticoid exposure. Plasma exchange should be considered for severe kidney  or life-threatening disease. Lower dose glucocorticoid induction regimens can be  used without compromising remission rates. Remission maintenance therapy is  recommended, and rituximab is usually first line over azathioprine.  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or methotrexate with low-dose glucocorticoids are  third-line options. Immunosuppression-associated infection risk remains a  concern, both during acute presentations and in the long term, highlighted by  the impact of rituximab on humoral immunity and vaccine response during the  COVID-19 pandemic. There remains an ongoing need for therapies that induce rapid  remission and optimize kidney recovery while minimizing infection risk. Clinical  trials are evaluating newer therapeutic options. Due to increasing treatment  options, management should be individualized, balancing effective  immunosuppression against comorbidities and frailty. SUMMARY: This review focuses on the treatment decision pathways for clinicians  and patients in the management of severe AAV (granulomatosis with polyangiitis  and microscopic polyangiitis). Key clinical trials, predictors of outcome, novel  therapeutics, and practical steps to mitigate infection risk are discussed. KEY MESSAGES: Immunosuppression regimens have been refined due to emerging  evidence from clinical trials. Rituximab, avacopan, and reduced-dose  glucocorticoid schedules have been the focus of recent studies. Infections and  immunosuppression-induced immunodeficiency must be considered when determining  individualized treatment.  Plain Language Summary: This is a review article on the management of  ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) aimed at clinicians. The focus is severe AAV  (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) with kidney  involvement. Key clinical features and investigations are summarized, as well as  data from clinical trials for remission induction and remission maintenance. In  addition, novel therapeutics and management of infection risk are discussed. Our  aim is to assist clinicians with an effective and safe approach to management of  patients with this potentially life-threatening condition.  © 2024 The Author(s). Published by S.

BACKGROUND: Long COVID is a common complication of infection with severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but the prevalence and predictors of the  condition remain poorly characterized. METHODS: We prospectively studied adults (≥18 years) with acute coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to an urban safety net hospital and  associated clinics between July 2020 and December 2022. Logistic regression  models were used to evaluate the association between baseline demographic,  clinical, and laboratory characteristics with long COVID status, defined as  symptoms persisting at least 9 months after acute disease. Among unrecovered  participants, we describe the prevalence of individual symptoms. RESULTS: We enrolled 222 participants, 162 (73%) of whom had known recovery  status by 9 months. Median age was 54 years, half (55%) were female, and the  majority of participants (78%) had at least 1 comorbidity at the time of  COVID-19 diagnosis. Based on acute illness characteristics, the adjusted odds  ratio for long COVID was 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-8.0) among those  with detectable nucleocapsid antigen and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.2-11) for those who  required supplemental oxygen. Of the 41% of participants with symptoms  persisting at least 9 months, central nervous system and psychological symptoms  were most commonly reported, with 57% reporting functional limitations due to  their persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association with initial disease suggests a decreasing  prevalence of long COVID as acute illnesses become milder. However, many  contemporary patients still experience high viral burden with extended viral  replication, even after vaccination. Our findings highlight the importance of  properly characterizing long COVID as viral evolution shifts acute disease  presentation.  © The Author(s) 2025.

INTRODUCTION: It is anticipated that Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  (COPD) has greater risk in acquiring COVID-19 infection and poorer outcome.  However, current worldwide data are conflicting. OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aims to compare the outcomes of COVID-19  patients with COPD and those without COPD in terms of length of hospital stay  (LOS), recovery or mortality, treatment received, and predictors of mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort chart review of 1,017 admitted adult  COVID-19 patients from July to December 2020. Age, gender, smoking status,  current control and medications for COPD, COVID-19 severity, symptoms,  treatment, and outcomes of the two study groups were compared. RESULTS: Prevalence rate of COPD was 3.8%. COVID-19 patients with COPD were  older (median age of 69 vs 54, p<0.001), male (87% vs 50%, p<0.001),  hypertensive (72% vs 48%, p=0.004), and with tuberculosis (31% vs 11%, p=0.002).  COVID-19 patients with COPD more commonly needed oxygen therapy, High Flow Nasal  Cannula, Mechanical Ventilation, Tocilizumab, Convalescent Plasma Therapy and  Dexamethasone, and had longer LOS. Significant risk factors for mortality are  malignancy, investigational therapies, smoking, and older age. There was no  difference in survival rates between the two groups. CONCLUSION: COPD increases the risk for severe COVID-19 and lengthens LOS.  © The Author(s) 2025.

Author information: (1)Division of Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry & Graduate School of  Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. (2)Committee for Oral Health Education, Myanmar Dental Association, Yangon,  Myanmar.  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted various  aspects of daily life, including oral health. However, limited research has  explored the effects of the pandemic on oral health perceptions, hygiene  behaviors, and their subsequent influence on oral health-related quality of life  (OHRQoL) in underserved settings. This study aims to assess changes in oral  health perceptions and behaviors during the pandemic and their impact on OHRQoL  in Myanmar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 at a  township health center in Yangon, Myanmar. A total of 158 participants were  included in the study. Clinical oral assessments were performed alongside  face-to-face interviews, which collected data on sociodemographic  characteristics, oral health perceptions and behaviors, psychological factors,  and OHRQoL. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests,  Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analyses were used to explore associations  and predictors of OHRQoL. RESULTS: Among the 158 participants, 30.4% reported a decline in oral health  perception, and 27.8% reported negative changes in oral hygiene behaviors during  the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes were significantly associated with a  history of COVID-19 infection, depressive symptoms, and bleeding on probing  during oral examinations. Regression analysis revealed that worsened oral health  perception (B = -2.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -5.00, -0.18) and negative  changes in hygiene behaviors (B = -2.27; 95% CI = -4.57, -0.02) were associated  with poorer OHRQoL. However, these associations became nonsignificant after  adjusting for confounding factors. Notably, a history of COVID-19 infection  requiring hospitalization remained a statistically significant predictor of  poorer OHRQoL in all models. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of participants reported worsened oral  health perception and negative changes in oral hygiene behaviors during the  COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to a decline in OHRQoL. However, the  influence of other confounding factors, such as psychological and socioeconomic  variables, needs to be carefully considered. Clinically, these findings  highlight the importance of integrating psychological support and targeted oral  health interventions in the post-pandemic recovery phase, particularly in  underserved settings. Public health initiatives should address the long-term  impacts of the pandemic on oral health behaviors and perceptions to improve  OHRQoL in affected populations.

(4)4Health Administration of the Karaganda Region, Karaganda, Republic of  Kazakhstan.  AIM OF THE STUDY: Analysis of clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters  in comorbid patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical, laboratory and  instrumental parameters in patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19  taking into account the treatment outcome (recovery or lethal outcome). A  multifactor logistic regression model was utilized to identify factors  influencing lethal outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with lethal severe COVID-19 had a lower rate of coronavirus  vaccination and more frequent dyspnea compared to patients with a favorable  prognosis. Additionally, blood oxygen saturation during hospitalization was  lower in cases of unfavorable outcomes than in cases of favorable outcomes, and  the extent of lung tissue damage was subtotal in most cases. The changes in  laboratory parameters during therapy in patients with favorable and unfavorable  outcomes were diverse and reflected the disease progression. According to the  highly sensitive and specific developed multifactor logistic regression model,  three key indicators significantly affecting the likelihood of lethal outcomes  in severe COVID-19 patients are the presence of cerebrovascular diseases, and  elevated levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the comprehensive analysis of clinical and  laboratory parameters revealed the main predictors of unfavorable outcomes in  severe COVID-19 cases: the presence of cerebrovascular diseases, and elevated  levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase.

METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study evaluates 800 PH and 484  post-ED adults from a single hospital in London, United Kingdom. Participants  had either confirmed laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or clinically  suspected acute COVID-19 and were offered post-COVID clinical follow-up at  approximately six weeks after their ED attendance or inpatient discharge, to  assess ongoing symptoms and support recovery. Multiple logistic regression  determined associations with specialist care referrals (SCR) to respiratory,  cardiology, physiotherapy (including chest physiotherapy), and mental health  services. RESULTS: Presence of at least one Long-COVID symptom was lower in adults  attending ED services with acute COVID-19 compared to those hospitalised (70.1%  post-ED vs. 79.5% PH adults, p < 0.001). Total number of Long-COVID symptoms was  associated with increased SCR in all patients (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.26,  95%CI:1.16, 1.36, p < 0.001), with post-ED adults more likely to need a SCR  overall (aOR = 1.82, 95%CI:1.19, 2.79, p = 0.006). Post-ED adults had higher SCR  to both physiotherapy (aOR = 2.59, 95%CI:1.35, 4.96, p = 0.004) and mental  health services (aOR = 3.84, 95%CI:2.00, 7.37, p < 0.001), with pre-existing  mental illness linked to the latter (aOR = 4.08, 95%CI:1.07, 15.6, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate greater specialist care referrals to mental health  and physiotherapy services in patients attending the ED and discharged with  acute COVID-19, compared to those admitted, despite lower ongoing COVID-19  symptom burden. Total number of symptoms, pre-existing co-morbidity such as  smoking status, cardiac co-morbidities, and mental health illnesses may predict  those requiring healthcare input. This information may enable better post-COVID  support for ED attendees, a distinct group who should not be neglected when  preparing for future pandemics.

A national cross-sectional study on latent profile analysis of occupational  fatigue among Chinese nurses in the early post-COVID-19 era.  He Q(1)(2), Ren J(1)(2), Wang G(1)(2), Wang Y(1)(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetric Nursing, West China Second University Hospital,  Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. (2)Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children  (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, China.  BACKGROUND: Occupational fatigue is a widespread condition within the nursing  workforce, adversely affecting both nurses' health and patient safety. The  protracted duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, approaching 3 years, has  exacerbated the challenges faced by nurses globally. The escalation in patient  numbers and the high incidence of infections among healthcare workers have  intensified occupational fatigue. This study seeks to explore the enduring  impact of the pandemic on occupational fatigue among Chinese nurses through a  latent profile analysis, and to identify the associated risk factors. METHODS: A comprehensive survey was conducted involving 2,140 nurses from 186  hospitals across China during the initial phase of the post-COVID-19 era. The  primary instruments utilized for data collection were the Occupational Fatigue  Exhaustion Recovery Scale and the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire. RESULTS: Three distinct profiles of occupational fatigue were identified: a low  fatigue/high recovery group (18.6%), a moderate fatigue/moderate recovery group  (48.8%), and a high fatigue/low recovery group (32.6%). The vast majority of  nurses reported experiencing moderate to high levels of occupational fatigue  during the early stage of the post-coronavirus era. Significant predictors for  membership in these fatigue profiles included marital status, possession of a  master's degree or higher, working over five night shifts per month,  experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and exhibiting higher scores in extrinsic effort  and overcommitment. CONCLUSION: Chinese nurses exhibit a relatively high level of occupational  fatigue in the early post-COVID-19 era, likely influenced by various  socio-demographic and work-related factors. It is imperative to develop targeted  interventions aimed at alleviating fatigue among specific groups of nurses to  effectively address the challenges posed by occupational fatigue in the face of  future public health disasters.

(#)Contributed equally  INTRODUCTION: Predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related  rehospitalization remain underexplored. This study aims to identify the main  risk factors associated with rehospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfections among residents of Lombardy,  northern Italy. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using two linked  administrative databases covering demographic data, comorbidities, hospital  records, and COVID-19 data of Lombardy residents. The study population included  patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 2020 and August 2021.  Rehospitalization was defined as a second COVID-19-related hospitalization  occurring at least 90 days after the first admission. The Fine-Gray  subdistribution hazard model was used to identify risk factors, accounting for  death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Out of 98,369 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 1,  2020 and August 31, 2021, 72,593 were alive 90 days after admission and 610 of  these (0.8%) were rehospitalized. A higher rehospitalization risk was observed  in older male patients with multiple comorbidities. Renal failure, liver  disease, and use of diuretics were significantly associated with  rehospitalization risk, while female biological sex and the use of  lipid-lowering drugs were associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study conducted on regional administrative  databases to investigate COVID-19 rehospitalizations. Through the availability  of a huge cohort, it provides a groundwork for optimizing care for individuals  at higher risk for COVID-19-related rehospitalizations. It underlines the need  for patient-management approaches that extend beyond the initial recovery. This  stresses the importance of ongoing monitoring and personalized interventions for  those at heightened risk not only of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection but also related  rehospitalizations.  © 2025.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease results in disparate responses between individuals  and has led to the emergence of long coronavirus disease (Long-COVID),  characterised by persistent and cyclical symptomology. To understand the  complexity of Long-COVID, the importance of symptom surveillance and prospective  longitudinal studies is evident. METHODS: A 9-month longitudinal prospective cohort study was conducted within  Scotland (n=287), using a mobile app to determine the proportion of recovered  individuals and those with persistent symptoms and common symptoms, and  associations with gender and age. RESULTS: 3.1% of participants experienced symptoms at month 9, meeting the  criteria for Long-COVID, as defined by the National Institute for Health and  Care Excellence terminology. The random effects model revealed a significant  time (month) effect for infection recovery (p<0.001, estimate=0.07). Fatigue,  cough and muscle pain were the most common symptoms at baseline, with fatigue  persisting the longest, while symptoms like cough improved rapidly. Older age  increased the likelihood of reporting pain (p=0.028, estimate=0.07) and  cognitive impairment (p<0.001, estimate=0.93). Female gender increased the  likelihood of headaches (p=0.024, estimate=0.53) and post-exertional malaise  (PEM) frequency (p=0.05, estimate=137.68), and increased time x gender effect  for PEM frequency (p=0.033, estimate=18.96). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of people fully recover from acute COVID-19, although  often slowly. Age and gender play a role in symptom burden and recovery rates,  emphasising the need for tailored approaches to Long-COVID management. Further  analysis is required to determine the characteristics of the individuals still  reporting ongoing symptoms months after initial infection to identify risk  factors and potential predictors for the development of Long-COVID.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a disease with diverse effects  on multiple organ systems, leading to varying presentations and severe  complications. As the pandemic progresses, the challenges faced by those who  recovered from the disease evolved as various coping strategies were adopted  post recovery. AIM: This study investigated the coping strategies used by individuals  recovering from COVID-19 to manage the physical, psychological, and social  impacts of the disease. It further explored the factors influencing these  strategies and their correlation with post-recovery quality of life. METHODS: This cross-sectional quantitative study involved 150 participants who  attended the Ghana Infectious Disease Centre's post-COVID-19 review clinic  between January and June 2021. Coping mechanisms were evaluated using the  Brief-COPE questionnaire, which covers 28 strategies across three styles:  Problem-focused coping, emotional-focused coping, and avoidant coping.  Participants rated their coping strategies on a 4-point Likert scale. Analysis  of variance was used to determine differences in use of coping strategies.  Quality of life was assessed with the EuroQol Group Association five-domain,  five-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the EQ-VAS scale. Spearman correlation  analyzed the relationship between coping strategies and quality of life. RESULTS: Majority of the study participants used problem-focused (2.71 ± 0.64  SD) type of coping strategy, followed by emotional-focused coping (2.32 ± 0.43  SD). The least strategy used was avoidant coping (1.57 ± 0.39 SD). Older  participants, non-healthcare workers, and those with complications or persistent  symptoms exhibited higher scores in avoidant and problem-focused coping. Those  with persistent symptoms had higher emotional-focused coping scores. Better  quality of life was associated with less reliance on all types of coping  strategies. CONCLUSION: Patients recovering from COVID-19 at the Ghana Infectious Disease  Centre used positive coping mechanisms effectively. Key predictors of coping  strategies included age, persistent symptoms, and complications. Improved  quality of life is correlated with reduced use of coping strategies.

(#)Contributed equally  INTRODUCTION: The 2019 COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact, leading to  numerous deaths, long recovery times, and economic challenges worldwide,  especially in countries with limited financial resources like Ethiopia. In  Ethiopia, Hawassa lacks viral shedding information. Identifying predictors can  help ease economic impact of illness.Therefore, this research aimed to examine  the demographics, clinical features, and recovery time of COVID-19 patients, as  well as determine predictive markers for severe adverse outcomes. METHODS: Study at Hawassa University Comprehensive Speciality Hospital COVID-19  quarantine and therapy facility in Ethiopia (Sep 24, 2020 - Nov 26, 2021) with  804 patients. Extracted clinical, epidemiological, demographic info from medical  records. Researchers used statistical tests like T tests, Chi-square tests, and  Fisher's exact tests to analyze relationships between variables. They also used  a Cox PH model to identify risk factors for COVID-19 patient recovery time.  Significance level was set at 0.05 for all analyses. RESULTS: Out of 804 COVID-19 patients, 74% recovered at an average age of 44.8  years, with 64.1% being male. Severe and critical cases were 24.1% and 21.4% of  the population, respectively, with only 16.0% of critical cases and 19.5% of  severe cases recovering. Average length of stay was 12.3 days. 88.4% of  recovered patients had symptoms, with chest pain (66.7%), cough (64.4%),  shortness of breath (59.2%), and fever (57.1%) being common. Nearly half had  comorbidities, with diabetes (15.9%) and hypertension (15.2%) prevalent. Male  patients had higher recovery rates, while severe/critical patients had lower  rates. Patients over 39 age category had lower recovery chance. Existence of at  least one comorbidities, diabetes, fever, and hypertension impacted recovery.  Fever with gender and shortness of breath affected recovery. Assumptions were  met with no multicollinearity. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies found that about 95% of COVID-19 patients recover  within 30 days, with a median of 12 days. Severe cases, elderly, and those with  comorbidities may take longer to recover. By effectively managing hypertension  and diabetes, individuals can improve their prognosis and facilitate a quicker  recovery. Public health concerns persist regarding COVID-19, especially for  comorbidities like diabetic and hypertension. Early detection of fever and  treatment of hypertension may expedite recovery.  © 2024. The Author(s).

Background/Objectives: Female sex is one of the Long COVID (LC) risk factors;  however, the LC predictors in females have not been established. This study was  conducted to assess the influence of LC on the cardiovascular system and to  assess the age-independent predictors of LC in females. Methods: Patient  information and the course of the disease with symptoms were collected in women  at least 12 weeks after COVID-19 recovery. The study participants were followed  for 12 months. ECG monitoring, 24 h ECG monitoring, 24 h blood pressure  monitoring, echocardiography, and biochemical tests were performed. Results: We  studied 1946 consecutive female patients (age 53.0 [43.0-63.0] vs. 52.5  [41.0-63.0], p = 0.25). A more frequent occurrence of LC was observed in females  with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.0001). Women with LC compared to the  control group had higher body mass index (p = 0.001), lower level of HDL  cholesterol (p = 0.015), higher level of TG (p < 0.001) and higher TG/HDL ratio  (p < 0.001), more often myocardial damage (p < 0.001), and lower LVEF (p =  0.01). LC women had more often QRS fragmentation, longer QTcB, and one of the  ECG abnormalities. In a multivariate analysis in younger females with BMI > 24.8  kg/m2, TG/HDL ratio > 1.89 and severe course of COVID-19 and in older females,  TG/HDL ratio > 1.89, lower LVEF, and also severe course of infection were  independent LC predictors. Conclusions: Independent predictors of LC occurrence  in women, regardless of age, are severe course of COVID-19 and TG/HDL ratio >  1.89. The presence of comorbidities and lifestyle before COVID-19 had no impact  on the occurrence of LC in females regardless of age.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the early predictors of a self-reported persistence of  long COVID syndrome (LCS) at 12 months after hospitalisation and to propose the  prognostic model of its development. DESIGN: A combined cross-sectional and prospective observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 221 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 who have undergone  comprehensive clinical, sonographic and survey-based evaluation predischarge and  at 1 month with subsequent 12-month follow-up. The final cohort included 166  patients who had completed the final visit at 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A self-reported persistence of LCS at 12 months after  discharge. RESULTS: Self-reported LCS was detected in 76% of participants at 3 months and  in 43% at 12 months after discharge. Patients who reported incomplete recovery  at 1 year were characterised by a higher burden of comorbidities (Charlson index  of 0.69±0.96 vs 0.31±0.51, p=0.001) and residual pulmonary consolidations  (1.56±1.78 vs 0.98±1.56, p=0.034), worse blood pressure (BP) control (systolic  BP of 138.1±16.2 vs 132.2±15.8 mm Hg, p=0.041), renal (estimated glomerular  filtration rate of 59.5±14.7 vs 69.8±20.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, p=0.007) and  endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery of  10.4±5.4 vs 12.4±5.6%, p=0.048), higher in-hospital levels of liver enzymes  (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 76.3±60.8 vs 46.3±25.3 IU/L, p=0.002) and  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (34.3±12.1 vs 28.3±12.6 mm/h, p=0.008),  slightly higher indices of ventricular longitudinal function (left ventricular  (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) of 18.0±2.4 vs 17.0±2.3%, p=0011) and  higher levels of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (7.3±4.2 vs  5.6±3.8, p=0.011) and depression scores (6.4±3.9 vs 4.9±4.3, p=0.022) and  EFTER-COVID study physical symptoms score (12.3±3.8 vs 9.2±4.2, p<0.001). At 1  month postdischarge, the persisting differences included marginally higher LV  GLS, mitral E/e' ratio and significantly higher levels of both resting and  exertional physical symptoms versus patients who reported complete recovery.  Logistic regression and machine learning-based binary classification models have  been developed to predict the persistence of LCS symptoms at 12 months after  discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with post-COVID-19 patients who have completely recovered  by 12 months after hospital discharge, those who have subsequently developed  'very long' COVID were characterised by a variety of more pronounced residual  predischarge abnormalities that had mostly subsided by 1 month, except for  steady differences in the physical symptoms levels. A simple artificial neural  networks-based binary classification model using peak ESR, creatinine, ALT and  weight loss during the acute phase, predischarge 6-minute walk distance and  complex survey-based symptoms assessment as inputs has shown a 92% accuracy with  an area under receiver-operator characteristic curve 0.931 in prediction of LCS  symptoms persistence at 12 months.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

The global atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation trajectory has been  subjected to fluctuations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Country-level  virus prevalence and geography conditions added complexity to understanding  atmospheric GHG accumulation sensitivities in terms of the growth rate. Here,  extensive data sets were comprehensively analyzed to capture historical and  projected fate of atmospheric GHG concentrations. Although a temporary slowdown  was observed during the lockdown, global atmospheric GHG growing rates exhibited  a sharp rebound during the early economic recovery after COVID-19, which would  threaten climate goals without proactive measures. Despite this consistent  global trend, various countries demonstrated differential relative changes in  growth rates, representing their specific responses to the pandemic crisis.  After systematic consideration of socio-economic and demographic factors and  employment of optimal regression models, transportation and industry variables  emerged as the strongest predictors for country-specific GHG accumulation  sensitivities during lockdown and recovery phases, respectively. Addressing  global health and climate change issues would necessitate sustainable government  actions and economic decisions in anticipation of future pandemic-related  events.

This study investigated the impact of mild COVID-19 on HRV in groups stratified  by time after infection and to compare to a healthy group of the same age  without previous virus infection and without need of hospitalization. This is a  cross-sectional study. We divided the sample into four groups: control group  (CG) (n = 31), group 1 (G1): ≤6 weeks (n = 34), group 2 (G2): 2-6 months  (n = 30), group 3 (G3): 7-12 months (n = 35) after infection. For HRV analysis,  we used the indices of linear (time and frequency domain) and non-linear  analysis. For comparisons between groups, ANOVA one way test or Kruskal-Wallis  was used according to the data distribution. The effect size was calculated  based on Cohen's d or η2. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed  to investigate the interaction between clinical outcomes and HRV parameters. A  total of 130 individuals were included. Groups G1 and G2 showed less  parasympathetic modulation when compared to CG (p < 0.05), while G3 showed an  increase in parasympathetic modulation when compared to G1 (p < 0.05). Moderate  to large effect sizes were found according to Cohen d or η2. The multiple linear  regression models identified age and infection duration as significant  predictors for RMSSD (adjusted R2 = 0.227) and SD1 (adjusted R2 = 0.242), while  age was significant for SDNN (adjusted R2 = 0.213). BMI, hypertension, and  dyslipidemia were non-significant in all models. For HF (n.u.), infection  duration was consistently significant, with stress emerging as a predictor in  Model 2 (adjusted R2 = 0.143). The recovery time since diagnosis and age  influences recovery from HRV, suggesting a transient effect of the disease on  the autonomic nervous system.  © 2024. The Author(s).

The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound and lasting impact on the mental health of  recovered individuals. To investigate the clinical risk factors associated with  long-term post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety, and depression in  COVID-19 survivors, demographic information and medical records were collected  during February 19 and March 20, 2020. Assessments of PTSS, anxiety, and  depressive symptoms were conducted at two months (April to May 2020, Session 1)  and two years (April to May 2022, Session 2) post-discharge. Session 1 included  127 survivors who were infected with the early strains of SARS-CoV-2, and 54 of  these participants took part in Session 2. PTSS (median: Session 1 = 9, Session  2 = 7; p = 0.522) and depression (median: Session 1 = 5, Session 2 = 4;  p = 0.127) remained unchanged over the two years following COVID-19 infection,  while anxiety (median: Session 1 = 5, Session 2 = 2; p < 0.001) significantly  decreased at the two-year mark. Severe COVID-19 symptoms were consistently  identified as significant risk factors for depression at both time points  (Session 1: dyspnea [beta = -0.268, p = 0.016], nausea or vomiting  [beta = 0.239, p = 0.031]; Session 2: headache [beta = 0.414, p = 0.014]). They  also emerged as risk factors for PTSS and anxiety at the two-month mark (PTSS:  cough [beta = -0.334, p = 0.002]; anxiety: continued oxygen therapy  [beta = 0.343, p = 0.002], cough [beta = -0.267, p = 0.013]). At the two-year  mark, blood sample characteristics were identified as risk factors for PTSS  (albumin: beta = 0.455, p = 0.010), anxiety (total bilirubin: beta = 0.440,  p = 0.013), and depression (total bilirubin: beta = 0.386, p = 0.021).  Mann-Whitney U-tests showed that female survivors had higher anxiety (p = 0.012)  and depression (p = 0.046) levels than males at the two-month mark. The sample  size was relatively small, and further investigation is needed to determine  whether our findings can be directly applied to other samples, including those  involving different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our study may highlight the  differences between short-term and long-term clinical risk factors for PTSS,  anxiety, and depression in COVID-19 survivors. The identified predictors could  provide valuable insights for tailoring interventions to improve the PTSS,  anxiety, and depression outcomes at different stages of recovery in COVID-19  survivors.  © 2024.

(2)Department of Clinical Research, Hôtel-Dieu de France University Medical  Center (HDFUMC) of the Saint-Joseph University of Beirut (USJ), Beirut, Lebanon.  BACKGROUND: The Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale is a validated tool  used to measure the functional status of patients discharged from the hospital. OBJECTIVES: To describe the functional limitations of hospitalized COVID-19  patients at the time of discharge and two months afterward, and to identify risk  factors associated with functional impairment. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: A total of 540 patients were included in this monocentric study. The  functional status assessment using the PCFS scale and ventilatory needs were  recorded at discharge and two months later. Univariate and multivariate analyses  were performed in order to identify the risk factors of a high PCFS score. RESULTS: Two months after discharge, the PCFS grade was 0 in 60,6% of the  survivors, 1 in 24.5%, 2 in 6.9%, 3 in 2.8%, and 4 in 5.3%. The identified risk  factors of a high PCFS scale were: age, arterial hypertension, diabetes  mellitus, immunosuppression, cardiovascular disease, high need for oxygen and  high News2 score at admission, a high percentage of ground glass at chest CT  scan performed at admission or during follow-up, elevated leukocytes,  neutrophils, LDH, D-dimers, procalcitonin, and serum creatinine levels. During  the hospital stay, treatment with steroids, tocilizumab, longer duration of  hospitalization, ICU admission and prolonged stay, and the occurrence of  thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events were also significantly associated with a  higher PCFS. Multivariate analysis identified that only age and a high News2  score at admission were independent risk factors of a low PCFS score. CONCLUSION: Multiple risk factors for a higher PCFS score were identified, but  only age and a high News2 score at admission were found to be independent risk  factors.  Plain Language Summary: Study aiming to identify the risk factors for functional  impairment in patients recovering from Severe COVID-19 infection. WHY WAS THE STUDY DONE? COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms  during the recovery phase, affecting their physical, cognitive, or mental health  and limiting their ability to engage in regular physical activities. The study  aims to identify the factors that best predict the functional impairment in  these patients. WHAT DID THE RESEARCHERS DO? The study included 540 patients. Their functional  status was assessed at discharge and again two months later using a specific  scale. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for  functional impairment. WHAT DID THE RESEARCHERS FIND? Two months after hospitalization for COVID-19, 4  out of 10 patients still exhibited mild to severe functional impairment. The  study identified several risk factors, with age and the severity of COVID-19  infection emerging as the most significant predictors of functional impairment  after severe COVID-19. WHAT DO THE FINDINGS MEAN? Clinicians and physicians taking care of COVID-19  hospitalized patients can use the identified risk factors to predict early on  which patients may require rehabilitation or home help following their recovery.  © The Author(s) 2024.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global mental  health, particularly among adolescents. However, little is known about how  mental health symptoms recover after the pandemic subsides. This study aims to  examine the recovery trajectories of ten mental health problems and suicidal  ideation among Chinese adolescents post-pandemic, with a focus on identifying  factors that influence different recovery patterns. METHODS: A total of 2,534 adolescents participated in a three-wave survey,  conducted in June 2022, November 2022, and March 2023, using the Mental Health  Scale for Chinese Middle School Students. A novel index was developed to account  for both the number and severity of mental health risk factors, allowing for the  classification of psychological symptoms into three subgroups: no, moderate, and  severe. Polynomial regression models were applied to determine the acceleration  inflection point, and multivariate logistic regressions identified predictors of  trajectory membership. RESULTS: Significant declines in psychological symptoms were observed. Seven  trajectory patterns were identified: resistance (37.85%), recovery (22.61%),  chronic-dysfunction (12.08%), aftermath-deterioration (10.81%),  stress-responsiveness (8.21%), vulnerability (5.76%), and remitting (2.68%).  Being female, senior high school students, and the oldest child in the family  hindered mental health recovery, whereas parenting styles of companionship,  empathetic support, promise fulfillment, and behavior intervention served as  protective factors. CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to reveal the post-pandemic mental  health recovery trajectories of Chinese adolescents, highlighting the importance  of considering both the number and severity of cumulative mental health  problems. The findings offer valuable insights into suicide prevention and the  development of targeted interventions to support youth mental health recovery.

Immunological characteristics in elderly COVID-19 patients: a post-COVID era  analysis.  Li Y(1), Chen Y(1), Liang J(1), Wang Y(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical  University, Beijing, China.  BACKGROUND: Advanced age is a primary risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes,  potentially attributed to immunosenescence and dysregulated inflammatory  responses. In the post-pandemic era, with containment measures lifted, the  elderly remain particularly susceptible, highlighting the need for intensified  focus on immune health management. METHODS: A total of 281 elderly patients were enrolled in this study and  categorized based on their clinical status at the time of admission into three  groups: non-severe (n = 212), severe survivors (n = 49), and severe  non-survivors (n = 20). Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to  identify independent risk factors associated with disease severity and  in-hospital outcomes. The diagnostic performance of risk factors was assessed  using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kaplan-Meier survival  analysis and log-rank test were utilized to compare the 30-day survival rates.  Furthermore, the transcriptomic data of CD4+ T cells were extracted from Gene  Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was  applied to reveal biological processes and pathways involved. RESULTS: In the comparison between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases,  significant elevations were observed in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio  (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) levels, concurrent  with a notable reduction in CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer (NK)  cells, and monocytes (all p < 0.05). CD4+ T cells (OR: 0.997 [0.995-1.000],  p<0.05) and NLR (OR: 1.03 [1.001-1.060], p<0.05) were independent risk factors  affecting disease severity. The diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 severity, as  measured by the area under the curve (AUC) for CD4+ T cells and NLR, was 0.715  (95% CI: 0.645-0.784) and 0.741 (95% CI: 0.675-0.807), respectively. Moreover,  patients with elevated NLR or IL-6 levels at admission exhibited significantly  shorter survival times. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed several  biological pathways that are implicated in the regulation of immune responses  and metabolic processes. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytopenia and the cytokine storm onset are significant  predictors of an unfavorable prognosis in elderly patients. The decrease in CD4+  T cells among elderly patients is detrimental to disease recovery, and the  biological pathways regulated by these cells could potentially heighten  vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby exacerbating the development of  associated complications.

Severe cases manifest with respiratory distress.  Corticosteroids, initially debated, are now recommended for severe cases  following the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial  findings. The timing of administration impacts outcomes, with earlier use  potentially improving mortality and ICU stays. Regional studies on timing in  severe cases are lacking, warranting further investigation. Methodology This  retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Medical Department of King  Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were extracted from  the BestCare database using a customized data collection sheet. Data were  cleaned in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and analyzed in IBM SPSS  (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Our study included 791 COVID-19 patients with  43.1% being female (n = 341) and 56.9% being male (n = 450). The mean age was  69.5 years (SD = 16.1). Regarding BMI, 52.4% (n = 414) were obese. Most  admissions were from the emergency department (90.6%, n = 717). Dexamethasone  was administered to 80.3% (n = 635) of patients, with 53.0% (n = 419) receiving  it early. Patients receiving early dexamethasone had significantly higher  discharge rates (p < 0.001). Mortality was higher among those receiving late  dexamethasone initiation (52.6%, p = 0.256). Moreover, there was an 87.5% death  rate for doses >6 mg (p < 0.001). Intravenous administration was associated with  higher mortality (62.3%, p < 0.001). Males had a higher likelihood of discharge  (OR = 1.426, p = 0.043). Age and ventilation needs were strong mortality  predictors (OR = 1.040, p < 0.001 and OR = 17.620, p < 0.001, respectively).  Higher BMI slightly reduced mortality risk (OR = 0.978, p = 0.049). Conclusion  Our study highlights significant associations between dexamethasone timing,  dosage, and route of administration with COVID-19 outcomes. Early dexamethasone  use correlated with higher discharge rates, while late initiation and higher  doses were linked to increased mortality. Age and ventilation needs were  critical predictors, with BMI showing a nuanced effect on mortality risk.  Copyright © 2024, Alonazi et al.

Predictors of hospitalization, death and incomplete/non-recovery from SARS-CoV-2  in an ambulatory global population.  STRIVE ICOS and PCOS Study Groups(2).  Collaborators: Pett SL(1).

(2)Division of Biostatistics & Health Data Science School of Public Health,  University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.  OBJECTIVES: To provide globally representative data on hospitalization and death  in recently SARS-CoV-2-positive ambulatory populations. METHODS: We enrolled SARS-CoV-2-positive ambulatory adults in the cohort  studies, ICOS (47 sites, 5 continents), and PCOS (Liberia) and followed for  28-days. Kaplan-Meier estimates of percentage of those hospitalized or died were  derived. Risk factors for hospitalization, death, and failure to recover were  identified using Cox and logistic models respectively. RESULTS: 9817(ICOS) and 125(PCOS) participants, 46.7% male; median age 43 years;  24.5% with comorbidity(s); 0.8% pregnant; 9.3% SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated, were  enrolled June-2020 and January-2022. By 28 days, 424(4.3%) participants were  hospitalized or had died; most within 7 days of enrolment(3.4%). Hospitalization  or death declined over calendar time i.e. 7.5%(2020); 4.1(first-half 2021) and  2.1%(second-half 2021), P < 0.0001. Older age, male sex, comorbidities,  pregnancy, symptomatic disease were each independently associated with  hospitalization or death; SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced this risk. At 28 days,  26.1% and 29.9% reported ongoing symptoms and failure to return to pre-morbid  health respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These global SARS-CoV-2 ambulatory cohort studies identified  demographic/clinical risks for hospitalization or death.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Predicting post-COVID-19 diabetes is crucial for  enhancing patient care and public health. This study investigates the role of  metabolic factors in predicting the glycemic outcomes in patients recovering  from moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 135 patients without  pre-existing diabetes, selected from a cohort of 1980 individuals hospitalized  between January 2020 and December 2022. Metabolic parameters, including blood  glucose, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR),  Triglyceride/Glucose (TyG) index, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  (hs-CRP), were assessed at discharge and followed up after 4 months (T4) and 12  months (T12). RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations of initial  glycemia, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP with the subsequent glycemic levels at T4 and T12.  Multiple regression analysis confirmed that initial glycemia, HOMA-IR, and  hs-CRP were strong predictors of elevated glycemia, while the TyG index did not  show a significant predictive value. Conventional diabetes risk factors,  including body mass index (BMI) and lipid profiles, showed low predictive power  for post-COVID-19 glycemia. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the critical role of metabolic and  inflammatory pathways in managing glycemic control in COVID-19 patients. Markers  like blood glucose, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP are significant predictors of blood  glucose levels, while the TyG index appears less helpful in this context. Early,  targeted interventions based on these markers can improve patient outcomes and  reduce the risk of post-COVID-19 complications like diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have greater  antibody titers than those with mild to moderate illness, but their association  with recovery or death from COVID-19 has not been characterized. METHODS: In a cohort study of 178 COVID-19 patients, 73 non-hospitalized and 105  hospitalized patients, mucosal swabs and plasma samples were collected at  hospital enrollment and up to 3 months post-enrollment (MPE) to measure virus  RNA, cytokines/chemokines, binding antibodies, ACE2 binding inhibition, and Fc  effector antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. The association of demographic  variables and more than 20 serological antibody measures with intubation or  death due to COVID-19 was determined using machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Predictive models reveal that IgG binding and ACE2 binding inhibition  responses at 1 MPE are positively and anti-Spike antibody-mediated complement  activation at enrollment is negatively associated with an increased probability  of intubation or death from COVID-19 within 3 MPE. CONCLUSIONS: At enrollment, serological antibody measures are more predictive  than demographic variables of subsequent intubation or death among hospitalized  COVID-19 patients.  Plain Language Summary: Part of the adaptive immune response to viruses, such as  SARS-CoV-2, is production of antibodies that are specific to the virus.  Hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 produce more antibodies against  SARS-CoV-2 than patients with mild to moderate disease. We studied antibody  responses in people with COVID-19 until either recovery or death from the  disease. Among hospitalized patients, we analyzed factors, including demographic  characteristics, comorbidities, and antibody features that could be used to  predict the requirement of intubation or the occurrence of death from COVID-19.  We found that antibody measurements taken when people were admitted to the  hospital were better at predicting adverse COVID-19 outcomes than either  demographic characteristics or comorbidities. These predictive measurements  could be useful indicators of disease severity during future pandemics.  © 2024. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: During the peak of the epidemic, hospitalized patients frequently  encountered significant health risks and potentially life-threatening  circumstances, including uncertainty regarding treatment and the potential for  complications. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among hospitalized patients 3 months after  discharge during the first peak of the epidemic, and the association of PTSD  with disease-related characteristics. DESIGN: A single-center and full-sample follow-up study was conducted on  COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Maternal and Child Hospital  of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Data were collected during their  hospitalization and 3 months after discharge. METHODS: PTSD symptoms were evaluated by primary care post-traumatic stress  disorder (PC-PTSD), a total score of 3 or above was considered as clinically  significant PTSD symptoms. Demographic and disease-related characteristics were  collected to identify related associations with PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 903 patients completed the follow-up survey, yielding a  response rate of 63.5%. A total of 212 (23.5%) of the patients were positive in  PC-PTSD screening. Univariate regression analysis identified several factors  correlated with PTSD symptoms, including female gender, younger age, a lower  body mass index (BMI), preexisting sleep problems, bereavement due to COVID-19,  a severe clinical diagnosis, the presence of three or more clinical symptoms at  disease onset, and residual respiratory symptoms after discharge. Notably, in  the multivariate regression analysis, experiencing three or more clinical  symptoms at onset emerged as a robust predictor of PTSD symptoms (OR = 2.09, 95%  CI: 1.48-2.95). An intriguing finding was that patients who underwent  radiological assessment post-discharge reported a higher incidence of PTSD  symptoms, whereas those who underwent re-testing for IgG or IgM antibodies  exhibited a lower prevalence of PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSION: Three months post-recovery, PTSD symptoms prevalence among COVID-19  patients was 23.5%. Those with three or more clinical symptoms at onset or  residual respiratory symptoms post-discharge showed higher risk. These findings  highlighted the long-term effect of COVID-19 on mental health, urging enhanced  attention and interventions for survivors.  Plain Language Summary: Prevalence and risk factors of PTSD symptoms: a  three-month follow-up study Why was the study done?: PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder) is a mental health condition that can develop after someone goes  through or witnesses an extremely frightening, life-threatening event. It’s a  type of ongoing mental distress that can show up later and last for a long time,  significantly affecting a person’s quality of life. The study aimed to find out  how many people who have gone through a public health emergency like COVID-19  develop PTSD symptoms within three months of recovery, and see if there’s a link  between these symptoms and their illness. What did the researchers do? The  research team did a single-center and full-sample follow-up study in COVID-19  patients who had recovered for three months. A tool called the PC-PTSD scale was  used to check if they had PTSD symptoms. If their score was 3 or above, it meant  they might have significant PTSD symptoms. The details about their illness were  also collected to see if there’s a connection with PTSD symptoms. What did the  researchers find? A total of 903 patients participated in the survey, with a  participation rate of 63.5%. Among them, 212 patients (23.5%) had a positive  result on the PC-PTSD test, indicating they might have PTSD symptoms. The study  found that several factors were linked to PTSD symptoms, such as being female,  younger age, having a low body weight, previous sleep issues, losing a loved one  due to COVID-19, having a severe COVID-19 diagnosis, experiencing three or more  symptoms at onset, and having residual respiratory issues after discharge.  Specifically, those who had three or more symptoms at onset were more likely to  develop PTSD. What do the findings mean? Within three months of COVID-19  recovery, 23.5% of patients may experience PTSD symptoms. Those who had three or  more symptoms at onset or had residual respiratory issues after discharge were  more likely to develop PTSD symptoms. This suggests that COVID-19 can have  long-term psychological effects on patients.  © The Author(s), 2024.  DOI: 10.1177/20451253241298816 PMCID: PMC11569496 PMID: 39552917"

What predicts cross-country differences in the recovery of socioeconomic  activity from the COVID-19 pandemic? To answer this question, we examined how  quickly countries' socioeconomic activity bounced back to normalcy from  disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic based on residents' attitudes,  values, and beliefs as measured in the World Values Survey. We trained nine  preregistered machine learning models to predict the rate at which various  socioeconomic metrics (e.g., public transportation occupancy, cinema attendance)  recovered from their COVID-19 lows based on the World Values Survey. All models  had high predictive accuracy when presented with out-of-sample data (rs ≥ .83).  Feature importance analyses identified five psychological predictors that most  strongly predicted socioeconomic recovery from COVID-19: religiosity, liberal  social attitudes, the value of independence, obedience to authority, and the  Protestant work ethic. Although past research has established the role of  religiosity, liberalism, and independence in predicting resilience, it has not  yet considered obedience to authority or the Protestant work ethic. Thus, the  current research suggests new directions for future work on resilience that may  not be apparent from either a deductive or an inductive approach.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on abdominal  trauma management by comparing pre-pandemic (17 February 2018-26 February 2020)  and pandemic periods (27 February 2020-7 March 2022). METHODS: Analyzing data from 118 patients at the Emergency County Clinical  Hospital of Craiova, we identified significant shifts in clinical practices  affecting patient outcomes. RESULTS: During the pandemic, a moderate increase in surgical interventions for  specific abdominal traumas indicated the effective adaptation of the medical  system. Prioritizing critical cases and deferring non-urgent procedures  optimized limited resources. Demographic and clinical factors-including age,  sex, body mass index (BMI), and red cell distribution width (RDW)-significantly  influenced the hospitalization duration and recovery outcomes. Gender  disparities in mortality lessened during the pandemic, possibly due to  standardized interventions and the physiological effects of SARS-CoV-2. The link  between occupation and obesity highlighted how work environments impact trauma  severity, especially as lifestyle changes affect BMI. While age remained a major  predictor of mortality, its influence slightly decreased, potentially due to  improved protocols for elderly patients. RDW emerged as an important prognostic  marker for disease severity and mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Employing advanced co-occurrence analysis enhanced with machine  learning, we uncovered complex relationships between clinical and demographic  variables often overlooked by traditional methods. This innovative approach  provided deeper insights into the collective impact of various factors on  patient outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the healthcare system's rapid  adaptations during the pandemic and offer critical insights for optimizing  medical strategies and developing personalized interventions in global crises.

D-dimer as a Predictor of ICU Admission and Mortality in COVID-19 Patients:  Insights From a Two-Year Retrospective Study From a Tertiary Care Center in  South India.  Stephen IR(1), Suman FR(1), Balasubramanian J(1), Shanmugam SG(1), Mani R(2).  Author information: (1)Pathology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research,  Chennai, IND. (2)Internal Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and  Research, Chennai, IND.  Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonitis results in a prothrombotic and hypercoagulable  state. Prognostic indicators are crucial for identifying patients at risk of  complications. D-dimer, a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, is a  specific marker for thrombosis. Elevated D-dimer levels have been strongly  correlated with poor prognosis and increased severity of illness in COVID-19  patients. Given D-dimer's eight-hour half-life, periodic measurement is  necessary to track disease progression. This study aimed to analyze and derive  threshold and peak D-dimer values to predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients,  comparing those treated in isolation wards to those requiring intensive care.  Methods This two-year retrospective observational study included patients above  18 years with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were categorized into those treated  in isolation wards and those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Based on  the outcome, they were further divided into survivors and non-survivors.  Demographic and outcome-related data were collected from the hospital's  laboratory information system. Serial D-dimer measurements were taken at eight  time points. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for  laboratory values and the chi-square test for demographic data. Receiver  operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to derive critical  D-dimer values. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for initial and  peak D-dimer values. Results Of 2.149 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 811  (38%) presented with elevated D-dimer levels. ICU admission was required for 239  patients, either due to direct admission or worsening conditions. An initial  D-dimer value of ≥0.93 mg/L FEU indicated the need for ICU admission, while a  peak D-dimer value of 5.65 mg/L FEU predicted mortality. The AUC for the initial  D-dimer was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.55-0.64), indicating moderate discriminatory power.  The AUC for the peak D-dimer was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54-0.62), suggesting lower  predictive accuracy for peak values. Sensitivity was high for both initial  (0.925) and peak (0.960) D-dimer values, although specificity was lower,  especially for the peak D-dimer (0.486), resulting in a higher rate of false  positives. Among the ICU patients, the age range was 27-97 years, with a mean of  53.5 years. Males were more affected than females (71% vs. 29%), with a  male-to-female ratio of 1.4:1. Of the ICU patients, 64.8% recovered, while 35.2%  succumbed to the disease. Younger patients (mean age: 50.5 ± 12 years) recovered  faster than older patients (mean age: 64 ± 16 years), with a significant  difference in recovery time (p < 0.001). Gender did not significantly impact  outcomes (p = 0.743). Survivors spent less time in the ICU (3-7 days) compared  to non-survivors (4-14 days) (p = 0.041). Conclusion Serial D-dimer monitoring  is essential for predicting outcomes and guiding treatment in COVID-19 patients.  Initial and peak D-dimer values can help identify patients requiring intensive  care and those at risk of mortality, allowing for timely interventions. D-dimer  levels should be integrated into routine clinical assessments for managing  COVID-19 patients.  Copyright © 2024, Stephen et al.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in restoring work ability and  facilitating the reintegration of post-COVID patients into the workforce. The  impact of rehabilitation on work ability and return to work (RTW) of post-COVID  patients remains poorly understood. This study was conducted to assess the work  ability and RTW of post-COVID patients before rehabilitation and 12 months after  rehabilitation and to identify physical and neuropsychological health factors  influencing RTW 12 months after rehabilitation. METHODS: This longitudinal observational study included 114 post-COVID patients  with work-related SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent inpatient post-COVID  rehabilitation with indicative focus on pulmonology and/or psychotraumatology  (interval between date of SARS-CoV-2 infection and start of rehabilitation:  M = 412.90 days). Employment status, work ability, and the subjective prognosis  of employment (SPE) scale were assessed before rehabilitation (T1) and 12 months  after rehabilitation (T4). The predictors analysed at T4 were functional  exercise capacity, physical activity, subjective physical and mental health  status, fatigue, depression, and cognitive function. Longitudinal analyses were  performed via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Logistic and linear regression  analyses identified predictors of work ability and return to work (RTW), whereas  mediation analyses examined the relationships between these predictors and work  ability. RESULTS: At T4, the median of WAI total score indicated poor work ability, which  significantly worsened over time (p < 0.001; r = 0.484). The SPE scale  significantly increased from T1 to T4 (p = 0.022, r = -0.216). A total of 48.6%  of patients had returned to work 12 months after rehabilitation. Fatigue was  identified as the main predictor of reduced work ability and RTW, with each unit  increase in fatigue severity decreasing the odds of RTW by 3.1%. In addition,  physical capacity and subjective health status were significant predictors of  perceived work ability. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the significant challenges that post-COVID  patients face in regaining work ability and achieving successful RTW 12 months  after rehabilitation. Fatigue appears to be an important predictor of work  ability and RTW. To optimize recovery and enhance both biopsychosocial health  and work ability, it is crucial to develop and implement personalised  interventions that address fatigue, improve physical capacity, and support  mental health.

BACKGROUND: The study assessed Global longitudinal strain imaging (GLS) to  detect subtle myocardial dysfunction among patients clinically recovered from  COVID-19. METHODS: All patients (n = 101 76 % males, mean age 55.45 ± 11.14 years), and  controls (n = 30), underwent clinical assessment and echocardiography, including  GLS assessment. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia was  comparable amongst patients and controls. The average GLS was significantly  lesser in post COVID patients (-16.21 ± 1.96 vs -18.49 ± 1.64 respectively,  p = 0.004) and significantly higher proportion of post COVID patients had  GLS > -18 % (43 % vs 22.58 % respectively, p = 0.001) as compared to controls.  The RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFLS) was also lower in the patient group  (22.35 ± 4.69 vs 24.19 ± 4.11, p = 0.004) and 21.7 % post COVID-19 patients had  pathological RV FWLS (> -20 %) vs controls (6.6 %). Average GLS was  significantly lesser in severe post COVID patients (viz -14.25 ± 1.92 vs  -16.63 ± 1.61 vs -17.63 ± 1.91, p < 0.0001, respectively among severe, moderate  and mild COVID-19 patients. On performing regression analysis, severity of  COVID-19 (OR 7.762) was a significant predictor of impaired GLS. CONCLUSION: Despite normal global LVEF, post COVID-19 recovered patients had  significantly lower LV GLS and RV FWLS with severe COVID-19 infection,  regardless of having a clinical recovery. This study reiterates the importance  of speckle tracking echocardiography as an important imaging modality for  detection of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in the post COVID-19 recovered  patients.

OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors associated with loss and recovery of smell and  taste after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) 2021 National Health  Interview Series (NHIS) database was used to analyze factors associated with  loss and recovery of smell and taste in respondents who had a previous COVID-19  infection. Significant variables from univariate analysis were included in a  stepwise backward regression model to identify independent predictors. RESULTS: Of the 3844 individuals who answered yes to having contracted COVID-19,  51.1% and 48.9% reported losing smell and taste, respectively. 95.7% recovered  smell and 97% recovered taste. Predictors associated with higher odds of  reporting a loss of smell included younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; 95%  confidence interval [CI] 0.98-0.99), female sex (OR 1.38; CI 1.17-1.63), use of  e-cigarettes (OR 1.59; CI 1.25-2.02), and Mexican ethnicity (OR 1.61; CI  1.22-2.11). Predictors of taste loss were younger age (OR 0.98; CI 0.98-0.99),  female sex (OR 1.31; CI 1.08-1.58), and higher BMI (OR 1.02; CI 1.00-1.04).  Female sex was associated with decreased odds of reporting a recovery of smell  (OR 0.74; CI 0.59-0.92) and taste (OR 0.54; CI 0.42-0.69). Black/African  American race (OR 1.44; CI 1.03-2.03) and non-Mexican Hispanic ethnicities (OR  1.55; CI 1.02-2.34) were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting  the recovery of smell. CONCLUSION: Various factors may be associated with the loss and recovery of  smell and taste after COVID-19 infections. Clinicians may use this information  to better counsel patients with these symptoms. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.  © 2024 The Author(s).

The SARS-COV2 pandemic caused significant disruptions in immunization delivery.  Baseline deficit gaps in immunization completion exacerbated ongoing disparities  in immunization coverage in low- and middle-income. Emerging reports focused on  global strategies for return to routine immunization schedules. Currently, there  are no studies that examined the dual challenge of returning to normal  immunization in a conflict-recovery setting, such as the ISIS (Islamic State of  Iraq and Syria) occupation of Iraq post-COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this  study was to estimate the number of children in Hadeetha, Iraq from 12 to  24 months of age who continued to be lost to the routine immunization schedule  due to the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns. Random sampling occurred from a compiled  district health facility registrar of all children in the target birth cohort  who had a 12-month immunization scheduled during the 2020 lockdown and were lost  to the immunization schedule. A total of 171 households from the sampling frame  were included in the final sample. In this cross-sectional study, survey data  was collected on the head of the household, the caregiver and the child.  Additional questions assessed vaccine hesitancy, vaccine information trusted  sources and COVID-19 impact on healthcare access. A risk factor analysis was  applied to assess using Chi-square (Χ2) for predictors of lack of DTP3  (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Polio) third dose completion. Of children in the study,  67.3 % did not complete the 6-antigen series at 12-months of age and 46.2 % were  missing DTP3 for vaccines to be completed during the pandemic shutdown. Specific  risk factors for lack of immunization for the DTP3 vaccine included area of  residence, age and caregiver knowledge of vaccines. Respondents indicated a  dependence on mass vaccination campaigns but also indicated a willingness to  receive phone reminders and television campaigns about vaccination schedules.

Electronic address:  jmpry@ucdavis.edu. (2)California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.  BACKGROUND: More than four years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,  understanding of SARS-CoV-2 burden and post-acute sequela of COVID (PASC), or  long COVID, continues to evolve. However, prevalence estimates are disparate and  uncertain. Leveraging survey responses from a large serosurveillance study, we  assess prevalence estimates using five different long COVID definitions among  California residents. METHODS: The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) conducted a  cross-sectional survey that included questions about acute COVID-19 infection  and recovery. A random selection of California households was invited to  participate in a survey that included demographic information, clinical  symptoms, and COVID-19 vaccination history. We assessed prevalence and  predictors of long COVID among those previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2  across different definitions using logistic regression. FINDINGS: A total of 2883 participants were included in this analysis; the  majority identified as female (62.5 %), and the median age was 39 years  (interquartile range: 17-55 years). We found a significant difference in long  COVID prevalence across definitions with the highest prevalence observed when  participants were asked about incomplete recovery (20.9 %, 95 % confidence  interval [CI]: 19.4-22.5) and the lowest prevalence was associated with severe  long COVID affecting an estimated 4.9 % (95 % CI 4.1-5.7) of the participant  population. Individuals that completed the primary vaccination series had  significantly lower prevalence of long COVID compared to those that did not  receive COVID vaccination. INTERPRETATION: There were significant differences in the estimated prevalence  of long COVID across different definitions. People who experience a severe  initial COVID-19 infection should be considered at a higher probability for  developing long COVID.

BACKGROUND: Research on healthcare disparities in pediatric radiology is  limited, leading to the persistence of missed care opportunities (MCO). We  hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities  in access to pediatric radiology services. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the social determinants of health and sociodemographic  factors related to pediatric radiology MCO before, during, and after the  COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study examined all outpatient pediatric radiology  exams at a pediatric medical center and its affiliate centers from 03/08/19 to  06/07/21 to identify missed care opportunities. Logistic regression with the  least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and  classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were used to explore factors  and visualize relationships between social determinants and missed care  opportunities. RESULTS: A total of 62,009 orders were analyzed: 30,567 pre-pandemic, 3,205  pandemic, and 28,237 initial recovery phase. Median age was 11.34 years (IQR  5.24-15.02), with 50.8% females (31,513/62,009). MCO increased during the  pandemic (1,075/3,205; 33.5%) compared to pre-pandemic (5,235/30,567; 17.1%) and  initial recovery phase (4,664/28,237; 16.5%). The CART analysis identified  changing predictors of missed care opportunities across different periods.  Pre-pandemic, these were driven by exam-specific factors and patient age. During  the pandemic, social determinants like income, distance, and ethnicity became  key. In the initial recovery phase, the focus returned to exam-specific factors  and age, but ethnicity continued to influence missed care, particularly in  neurological exams for Hispanic patients. Logistic regression revealed similar  results: during the pandemic, increased distance from the examination site (OR  1.1), residing outside the state (OR 1.57), Hispanic (OR 1.45), lower household  income ($25,000-50,000 (OR 3.660) and $50,000-75,000 (OR 1.866)), orders for  infants (OR 1.43), and fluoroscopy (OR 2.3) had higher odds. In the initial  recovery phase, factors such as living outside the state (OR 1.19), orders for  children (OR 0.79), and being Hispanic (OR 1.15) correlate with higher odds of  MCO. CONCLUSION: The application of basic data science techniques is a valuable tool  in uncovering complex relationships between sociodemographic factors and  disparities in pediatric radiology, offering crucial insights into addressing  inequalities in care.  © 2024.

This study aimed to determine COVID-19 recovery time and identify predictors  among hospitalized patients in the Dhanusha District of Madhesh Province, Nepal.  This hospital-based longitudinal study involved 507 COVID-19 patients admitted  to three distinct medical facilities for therapeutic intervention between April  and October 2021. Data were collected for patient demography, symptoms, vital  signs, oxygen saturation levels, temperatures, heart rates, respiratory rates,  blood pressure measurements, and other health-related conditions. Kaplan-Meier  survival curves estimated the recovery time, and a Cox proportional hazard model  was used to identify the predictors of recovery time. For the total  participants, mean age was 51.1 (SD = 14.9) years, 68.0% were males. Of the  total patients, 49.5% recovered, and 16.8% died. The median for patient recovery  was 26 days (95% CI: 25.1-26.7). Patients with severe or critical conditions  were less likely to recover compared to those with milder conditions (hazard  ratio (HR) = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15-0.79; p = 0.012). In addition, an increase in  oxygen saturation was associated with an elevated likelihood of recovery (HR =  1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17, p = 0.018). This study underscores the need for early  admission to hospital and emphasizes the targeted interventions in severe cases.  Additionally, the results highlight the importance of optimizing oxygen levels  in COVID-19 patient care.

Electronic address:  lbankova@bwh.harvard.edu.  BACKGROUND: In 2% to 4% of patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  chemosensory dysfunction (CSD) persists beyond 6 months, accounting for up to 4  million people in the United States. The predictors of persistence and recovery  require further exploration. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the predictors of recovery and assess the quality  of CSD in registry subjects with self-reported persistent smell and taste  dysfunction after COVID-19. METHODS: COVID-19 CSD participants (n = 408) from the 4 major waves of the  pandemic completed questionnaires at 4 time points between 2021 and 2023,  assessing demographics, sinonasal symptoms, and self-assessed recovery.  Objective measurements of smell (UPSIT) and taste (BWETT) were performed on a  subcohort (n = 108). RESULTS: In this chronic CSD cohort, the average symptom duration was 24 ± 5  months, with 70% of those who contracted COVID-19 in 2020 report ongoing  dysfunction. Phantosmia and dysgeusia were most prevalent in the early waves of  COVID-19, while most participants reported disrupted ability to distinguish  scents and flavors as well as undulating chemosensory function. Subjects  reported low incidence of subjective sinonasal symptoms but high prevalence of  sleep and mood disturbance. Cigarette smoke phantosmia was predictive of  persistence of CSD. Conversely, self-reported environmental allergies and  hypertension were predictive of recovery, and dust mite allergies specifically  were negative predictors of cigarette smoke phantosmia. Finally, no treatment  resolved CSD, but nasal steroids were reported to be effective by recovered CSD  subjects. Objective measures of both smell and taste were significantly reduced  in patients with chronic CSD compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic COVID-19 CSD is a syndrome resistant to standard  anti-inflammatory therapy. Preexisting environmental allergies and hypertension  predict recovery, while cigarette smoke phantosmia predicts persistence.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs), also known as long COVID, is  persistently debilitating disorders that need investigation on their incidence,  morbidity, and case-fatality rate. PURPOSE: The objectives of this cohort study were to determine the incidence,  characteristics, case-fatality, morbidity, and recovery of post-COVID-19  symptoms throughout a two-year period of observation. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study of post-COVID-19 cases among  12,925 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in eight administrative districts of  Bangladesh between July and December 2021-2023. PCC was diagnosed according to  WHO clinical diagnostic criteria, and the screening procedure was completed  through a household screening process. RESULTS: The incidence of PCC was 3.6%, the case-fatality rate was 1.92%, and  the recovery rate was 9.0%. The significant predictors of PCC morbidity were  geographical distribution, vaccination, comorbidities, and a longer duration of  symptoms or multiple symptoms (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nearly 465 out of 522 people suffering from PCC are persistent and  have a significant disability. However, the rate of recovery was 9.0%. It is  necessary to investigate approaches to improve the recovery of PCC in  Bangladesh.  © 2024. The Author(s).

Background: Depression is one of the most severe sequelae of COVID-19, with  major depressive disorder often characterized by disruption in white matter (WM)  connectivity stemming from changes in brain myelination. This study aimed to  quantitatively assess brain myelination in clinically diagnosed post-COVID  depression (PCD) using the recently proposed MRI method, macromolecular proton  fraction (MPF) mapping. Methods: The study involved 63 recovered COVID-19  patients (52 mild, 11 moderate, and 2 severe) at 13.5 ± 10.0 months  post-recovery, with matched controls without prior COVID-19 history (n = 19). A  post-COVID depression group (PCD, n = 25) was identified based on psychiatric  diagnosis, while a comparison group (noPCD, n = 38) included participants with  neurological COVID-19 complications, excluding clinical depression. Results:  Fast MPF mapping revealed extensive demyelination in PCD patients, particularly  in juxtacortical WM (predominantly occipital lobe and medial surface), WM tracts  (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), posterior thalamic radiation,  external capsule, sagittal stratum, tapetum), and grey matter (GM) structures  (hippocampus, putamen, globus pallidus, and amygdala). The noPCD group also  displayed notable demyelination, but with less magnitude and propagation.  Multiple regression analysis highlighted IFOF demyelination as the primary  predictor of Hamilton scores, PCD presence, and severity. The number of  post-COVID symptoms was a significant predictor of PCD presence, while the  number of acute symptoms was a significant predictor of PCD severity.  Conclusions: This study, for the first time, reveals extensive demyelination in  numerous WM and GM structures in PCD, outlining IFOF demyelination as a key  biomarker.

The study aimed to explore the key determinants that impact the quality of life  (QoL) transformation of those who have recuperated from COVID-19 in the Dhaka  metropolis, particularly 18 months post-recovery. RT-PCR confirmed that 1,587  COVID-19 patients from Dhaka were included in the study. The baseline was June -  November 2020, subsequently recovered and interviewed 18 months after their  initial recovery. The follow-up included 1587 individuals using the WHOQOL-BREF  questionnaire. After excluding 18 deaths, 53 refusals, 294 inaccessible  participants, and 05 incomplete data entries, we analysed the data of the 1217  respondents. The average physical domain score decreased significantly from  baseline to follow-up, whereas a significant increase in average scores has been  observed in other domains at the follow-up (p<0.05). GEE equation shows after  adjusting for other factors, older age, female gender, higher education, higher  family income, hospital admission during COVID-19, and the number of  comorbidities were significantly associated with changing individuals' QoL  scores. Monthly family income >60000 BDT, being married and having no previous  vaccination history are significant in reducing people's QoL scores in the  psychological domain. On the other hand, age, employment status, monthly family  income, marital status, smoking history, and COVID-19 reinfection were  significantly associated with altering an individual's QoL scores in the social  domain. The overall QoL of COVID-19 recovered people improved in all domains  after 18 months, except the physical realm. Participants' age, employment  status, family income, marital status, smoking history, comorbidities, COVID-19  vaccination, and COVID-19 reinfection were responsible for altering people's QoL  index.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most stressful events in recent times  across the world. The long-term effect of these experiences raises several  concerns, including the development of post-traumatic stress symptomatology.  However, little is known about the psychological processes that mediate this  association. The aim of this study was to explore the association of emotional  exhaustion and anxiety in post-traumatic stress symptomatology, and the  mediating role of resilience and psychological well-being in university  students. A total of 526 university students of both sexes participated in this  study, and they were aged between 17 and 62 years old. Symptoms of anxiety and  emotional exhaustion were significantly higher in females, in contrast, males  showed on average more resilience and psychological well-being. Additionally,  participants with COVID-19 infection had higher levels of emotional exhaustion,  anxiety, and PTSD. The results indicated that the variables were correlated with  each other (p < 0.001). A conceptual model was confirmed that describes anxiety  and emotional exhaustion as predictors, post-traumatic stress symptomatology as  an outcome variable, and resilience and psychological well-being as mediators.  Resilience and psychological well-being can be important protective factors for  adaptive responses in stressful situations. The findings obtained in this study  will provide a theoretical basis for designing targeted interventions to improve  psychological health, whether for crisis intervention, the process of adapting  to higher education, or for recovery plans from psychological trauma.

BACKGROUND: The severe course of COVID-19 causes cardiovascular injuries,  although the mechanisms involved are still not fully recognized, linked, and  understood. Their characterization is of great importance with the establishment  of the conception of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, referred to as long COVID,  where blood clotting and endothelial abnormalities are believed to be the key  pathomechanisms driving circulatory system impairment. METHODS: The presented study investigates temporal changes in plasma proteins in  COVID-19 patients during hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and six  months after recovery by targeted SureQuant acquisition using PQ500 panel. RESULTS: In total, we identified 167 proteins that were differentially regulated  between follow-up and hospitalization, which functionally aggregated into immune  system activation, complement and coagulation cascades, interleukins signalling,  platelet activation, and extracellular matrix organization. Furthermore, we  found that temporal quantitative changes in acute phase proteins correlate with  selected clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In-depth targeted proteome investigation evidenced substantial  changes in plasma protein composition of patients during and recovering from  COVID-19, evidencing a wide range of functional pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2  infection. In addition, we show that a subset of acute phase proteins, clotting  cascade regulators and lipoproteins could have clinical value as potential  predictors of long-term cardiovascular events in COVID-19 convalescents.  © 2024.

OBJECTIVES: Few panel studies have investigated how different types of mental  health (MH) and socio-emotional wellbeing (SEW) outcomes have changed during the  pandemic and if their burden has been equally distributed at the  population-level. We aimed to examine temporal changes in these outcomes and  their socio-ecological predictors using panel data. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal population-based survey with overlapping panels. METHODS: Analyses were carried out using four measurements of data from the  Health and Social Survey (April 2020 to April 2021). Participants included  Andalusian (Spanish) residents aged 16 years or older who participated in all  four measurements (n = 1223). Seven dichotomous MH and SEW outcomes, as well as  several socio-ecological predictors informed by a conceptual model, were  examined in descriptive and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Unadjusted odds of regular/bad perceived mental health (vs.  excellent/very good/good), low socio-emotional wellbeing (vs. regular), low  happiness (vs. regular), and feeling anxious (vs. not feeling anxious) decreased  significantly from the first to the second measurement; however, in the fourth,  low socio-emotional wellbeing significantly increased while low optimism  decreased. Considering varying coefficients, objectively measured COVID-19  status and self-reported severity levels of the infection were statistically  significant. Health status, social support, and household financial difficulty  predicted higher adjusted odds in most of the seven assessed outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Significant temporal variations in MH and SEW outcomes, along with  their predictors, were observed during the first year of the pandemic. Some of  these outcomes worsened as the pandemic progressed, whereas others improved.  Findings also suggest that some individuals such as those experiencing poor  health, limited social support, and low socioeconomic status are  disproportionately impacted.  © 2024. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized patients with  COVID-19 and associated with worse prognosis. The Spanish Society of Nephrology  created the AKI- COVID Registry to characterize the population admitted for  COVID-19 that developed AKI in Spanish hospitals. The need of renal replacement  therapy (RRT) therapeutic modalities, and mortality in these patients were  assessed MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from  the AKI-COVID Registry, which included patients hospitalized in 30 Spanish  hospitals from May 2020 to November 2021. Clinical and demographic variables,  factors related to the severity of COVID-19 and AKI, and survival data were  recorded. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to study factors  related to RRT and mortality. RESULTS: Data from 730 patients were recorded. A total of 71.9% were men, with a  mean age of 70 years (60-78), 70.1% were hypertensive, 32.9% diabetic, 33.3%  with cardiovascular disease and 23.9% had some degree of chronic kidney disease  (CKD). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 94.6%, requiring ventilatory support in 54.2%  and admission to the ICU in 44.1% of cases. The median time from the onset of  COVID-19 symptoms to the appearance of AKI (37.1% KDIGO I, 18.3% KDIGO II, 44.6%  KDIGO III) was 6 days (4-10). A total of 235 (33.9%) patients required RRT: 155  patients with continuous renal replacement therapy, 89 alternate-day dialysis,  36 daily dialysis, 24 extended hemodialysis and 17 patients with  hemodiafiltration. Smoking habit (OR 3.41), ventilatory support (OR 20.2),  maximum creatinine value (OR 2.41), and time to AKI onset (OR 1.13) were  predictors of the need for RRT; age was a protective factor (0.95). The group  without RRT was characterized by older age, less severe AKI, and shorter kidney  injury onset and recovery time (p < 0.05). 38.6% of patients died during  hospitalization; serious AKI and RRT were more frequent in the death group. In  the multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.03), previous chronic kidney disease (OR  2.21), development of pneumonia (OR 2.89), ventilatory support (OR 3.34) and RRT  (OR 2.28) were predictors of mortality while chronic treatment with ARBs was  identified as a protective factor (OR 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AKI during hospitalization for COVID-19 had a high  mean age, comorbidities and severe infection. We defined two different clinical  patterns: an AKI of early onset, in older patients that resolves in a few days  without the need for RRT; and another more severe pattern, with greater need for  RRT, and late onset, which was related to greater severity of the infectious  disease. The severity of the infection, age and the presence of CKD prior to  admission were identified as a risk factors for mortality in these patients. In  addition chronic treatment with ARBs was identified as a protective factor for  mortality.  Copyright © 2023 Sociedad Española de Nefrología. Published by Elsevier España,  S.L.U.

Socially  vulnerable communities in low- and-middle-income countries were severely  impacted by the pandemic and are underrepresented in research. This prospective  study aimed to determine the prevalence of long COVID, its impact on health, and  associated risk factors in one such community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: A total of 710 individuals aged 18 and older, with confirmed SARS-CoV-2  infection at least three months prior, were enrolled between November 25, 2021,  and May 5, 2022. Participants were assessed via telephone or in person using a  standardized questionnaire to evaluate their perception of recovery, symptoms,  quality of life, and functional status. FINDINGS: Twenty percent of participants did not feel fully recovered, 22%  experienced new or persistent symptoms, 26% had worsened functional status, 18%  had increased dyspnoea, and 32% reported a worse quality of life. Persistent  symptoms included headache, cough, fatigue, muscle pain, and shortness of  breath. Dyspnoea during the acute phase was the strongest independent predictor  of worsening outcomes. Females and individuals with comorbidities were more  likely to report worse recovery, functioning, dyspnoea, and quality of life. INTERPRETATION: Our findings reveal a high burden of severe and persistent  physical and mental health sequelae in a socially vulnerable community following  COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION: Lymphocytopenia has emerged as a simply obtained laboratory value  that may correlate with prognosis. In this study we aim to study absolute  Lymphocyte count after clinical recovery. METHOD AND MATERIAL: Observational study was conducted in Covid dedicated  Hospital in Mizoram. Absolute lymphocyte count is obtained from the differential  leucocyte count of the patients. The obsolute Lymphocyte count at the time of  hospital admission is compared with the Absolute Lymphocyte count at the time of  hospital discharge after the patient obtained clinical recovery. RESULT: Absolute Lymphocyte Count at the time of admission has a mean of 2004.48  and standard deviation of 1204.868. Absolute Lymphocyte Count at the time of  discharge has a mean of 1943.68 and standard devaiton of 842.228. Pearsons  correlation coefficientis showed that there is positive correlation between the  variables (Correlation coeffiecient = .325). Also, the correlation is  statistically significant (P < 0.05). Paired Sample t-test showed there is no  statistical significant difference between Absolute Lymphocyte Count- at the  time of admission and at the time of discharge (P > 0.05) at 95% Conficence  Interval. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that Absolute Lymphocyte count had no signicant  difference at the time of hospital admission and after clinical recovery.

This study  evaluated the long-term impact of diabetes on persistent radiological pulmonary  abnormalities and lung function impairment in COVID-19 survivors over three  years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, cohort study, pulmonary  sequelae were compared between COVID-19 survivors with and without diabetes.  Serial chest CT scans, symptom questionnaires and pulmonary function tests were  obtained 6 months, 12 months, 2 years and 3 years post-discharge. The  independent predictors for lung dysfunction at the 3-year follow-up were  analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 278 COVID-19 survivors (63 [IQR 57-69] year-old, female: 103  [37.0%]) were included. At the 3-year follow-up, individuals in the diabetes  group had higher incidences of respiratory symptoms, radiological pulmonary  abnormalities and pulmonary diffusion dysfunction than those in the control  group. Diabetes (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.04-4.59, p = 0.034), allergy (OR: 2.26, 95%  CI: 1.09-4.74, p = 0.029), female (OR: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.37-5.29, p = 0.004),  severe COVID-19 (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.54-10.93, p = 0.005), and fibrotic-like CT  changes (OR: 5.64, 95% CI: 2.28-13.98, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of  pulmonary diffusion dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the long-term deleterious effect of diabetes  status on radiological pulmonary abnormalities and pulmonary dysfunction in  COVID-19 survivors. This study provides important evidence support for long-term  monitoring of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 recovery survivors with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the trends and ecological  determinants of physical activity among U.S. children and adolescents during the  2019-2021 period, encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic's onset and subsequent  years. METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Survey of Children's Health over three  years, this cohort study analyzed physical activity levels and ecological  determinants among 82,068 participants aged 6-17. The sample included 36,133  children (44%) and 45,935 adolescents (56%), with variables assessed by  caregiver reports. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant decline in physical activity among  children from 2019 to 2020, followed by a recovery in 2021, whereas adolescents  showed a continued decrease without recovery. Over the study period, children  were consistently more active than adolescents. Better health status, normal  weight, less screen time, stronger peer relationships, higher parental  involvement, better family resilience and greater school participation were  consistently correlated with increased physical activity in both age groups.  Sleep duration was a predictor of activity only in children, while mental health  status was solely a predictor in adolescents. Neighborhood environment  consistently predicted children's activity levels but was a significant factor  for adolescents only in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the differing impacts of the pandemic on  physical activity between children and adolescents, emphasizing the need for  targeted public health interventions, particularly for adolescents whose  activity levels have not recovered from the pandemic period. Age-specific  physical activity interventions should consider sleep duration and neighborhood  environmental factors when targeting children and mental health factors when  focused on adolescents.  © 2024.

Yılmaz M(1), Mirzaoğlu Ç(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, University of Health Sciences, Elazığ Fethi Sekin  City Hospital, 23280 Elazığ, Turkey.  AIM: Abnormal P-wave axis (aPwa) have been correlated with an increased risk of  supraventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to analyze whether  infection with COVID-19 may cause a predisposition for supraventricular  arrhythmia in the long term, following recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a total of 252 subjects with a confirmed  history of COVID-19 (recovered COVID-19) and 251 healthy subjects without a  history of COVID-19 were included. The recovered COVID-19 group was divided into  three subgroups designated as mild, moderate, and severe according to the  severity score of their chest CT. The aPwa data were obtained using 12-lead  electrocardiography (ECG) and compared between the healthy subjects and the  recovered COVID-19 subgroups. RESULTS: This study showed that in the recovered severe COVID-19 subgroup the  prevalence of aPwa was significantly increased compared to the controls and the  other COVID-19 subgroups. No correlation could be detected in Spearman's Rho  correlation between the existence of aPwa and the number of positive PCR tests  for COVID-19 and the time elapsed after infection with COVID-19. The binary  logistic regression analysis showed that recovery from severe COVID-19, the  severity score of the chest CT in the recovered from COVID-19 subjects, and the  existence of hypertension (HT) were all independent predictors of aPwa (hazard  ratio: 3.542, 95% confidence interval: 1.398-8.969, p: 0.01; hazard ratio:  0.896, 95% confidence interval: 0.840-0.955, p < 0.001; hazard ratio: 2.710, 95%  confidence interval: 1.079-6.804, p: 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who have recovered from severe COVID-19 have shown an  increased prevalence of aPwa. The existence of aPwa was not associated with the  number of positive PCR tests for COVID-19 or the time elapsed after infection  with COVID-19. Therefore, recovery from severe COVID-19 is an independent  predictor of electrocardiographic abnormal P-wave axis.

BACKGROUND: Despite considerable research into COVID-19 sequelae, little is  known about differences in illness duration and complications in patients  presenting in primary care with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections  (RTI) that are and are not attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether aetiology impacted course of illness and  prediction of complications in patients presenting in primary care with symptoms  of RTI early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between April 2020-March 2021 general practitioners from nine European  countries recruited consecutively contacting patients with RTI symptoms. At  baseline, an oropharyngeal-nasal swab was obtained for aetiology determination  using PCR after follow-up of 28 days. Time to self-reported recovery was  analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Predictors (baseline variables of  demographics, patient and disease characteristics) of a complicated course  (composite of hospital admission and persisting signs/symptoms at 28 days  follow-up) were explored with logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: Of 855 patients with RTI symptoms, 237 (27.7%) tested SARS-CoV-2  positive. The proportion not feeling fully recovered (15.6% vs 18.1%, p = 0.39),  reporting being extremely tired (9.7% vs 12.8%, p = 0.21), and not having  returned to usual daily activities (18.1% vs 14.4%, p = 0.18) at day 28 were  comparable between SARS-CoV-2 positive (n = 237) and negative (n = 618) groups.  However, among those feeling fully recovered (SARS-CoV-2 positive: 200 patients,  SARS-CoV-2 negative: 506 patients), time to full recovery was significantly  longer in SARS-CoV-2 patients (10.6 vs 7.7 days, p < 0.001). We found no  evidence that predictors of a complicated course differed between groups  (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Early in the pandemic, the proportion of patients not feeling fully  recovered by 28 days was similar between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative  patients presenting in primary care with RTI symptoms, but it took somewhat  longer for SARS-CoV-2 patients to feel fully recovered. More research is needed  on predictors of a complicated course in RTI.  Plain Language Summary: Our primary care-based observational study found that  recovery by 28 days was comparable between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative RTI  patients.Future research is needed to unravel which host- and pathogen-related  profiles are associated with higher risk of complications and persisting  symptoms among patients presenting in primary care with RTI symptoms.

Previous research has identified an increase in internalizing problems during  the COVID-19 pandemic in children and adolescents with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Additionally, it has been  observed that parents of children with ADHD had elevated levels of anxiety  during the pandemic. The current study aimed to longitudinally assess whether  the impact of COVID-19 was associated with internalizing problems in children  and adolescents with ADHD during the middle (Time 1-Spring 2021 [T1]) and end  (Time 2-Fall/Winter 2022 [T2]) of the pandemic, and whether parental anxiety  moderated this relationship over time. Canadian parents of youth with ADHD (aged  3-18 years old) completed online questionnaires assessing their child's  depression and anxiety symptoms, their own anxiety symptoms, and the pandemic's  impact on their child, both at T1 (N = 278) and T2 (N = 89). The results  indicated that the impact of COVID-19 on children at T1 was a unique predictor  of child internalizing problems at T1 but not at T2. While parental anxiety did  not moderate this association cross-sectionally, it was a significant moderator  longitudinally. More specifically, low parental anxiety at T1 positively  moderated the association between the COVID-19 impact on children at T1 and  child internalizing problems at T2. The results highlight the importance of  providing on-going psychological support for children and adolescents with ADHD  and emphasize the need to aid parents in effectively supporting their children  during the process of pandemic recovery.  © 2024.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize long-term patient-reported symptoms and quality of  life, in adults after COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in Cantabria (Northern Spain)  including adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 694) with a time  period between 4.7 and 24 month post-SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, and their close  contacts (n = 663) (PCR negative and without suspected infection) obtained from  simple random sampling of a total of 47,773 cases and 94,301 close contacts. The  ISARIC survey was used as screening tool with self-reported ""non-feeling fully  recovery (NFFR)"" defined as primary outcome. RESULTS: 16.57% (n = 115/694) reported NFFR. Most prevalent symptoms were in  order of frequency: Fatigue (54.8%); Loss of smell (40.9%); Problems speaking or  communicating (29.6%); Loss of taste (28.7%); Confusion/lack of concentration  (27.8%); Persistent muscle pain (24.3%) and Shortness of breath/breathlessness  (23.5%). When comparing the three ordinal groups (Close contacts, COVID-19  feeling recovered, and COVID-19 NFFR) the prevalence of these symptoms was  increasingly higher among each ordinal group (p < 0.001). Female gender was  significantly associated with NFFR: (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.56); as well  as older age: aOR per 10 year increment = 1.15. Lastly, they scored on average  9.63 points less in Euroquol. CONCLUSIONS: More than 15% of patients in our real-life population-based study,  reported NFFR, being female sex and older age independent predictors of this  condition. Most symptoms in these patients were in accordance with WHO  definition of post COVID-19 condition in adults, and were less prevalent in  COVID-19 feeling recovered and close contact respectively, with a statistically  significant dose-response pattern, and with a large decrease in quality of life  according to Euroquol.  Publisher: OBJETIVO: Caracterizar los síntomas y la calidad de vida informados a  largo plazo después de un episodio agudo de COVID-19. MÉTODOS: Estudio transversal en Cantabria (norte de España) que incluye adultos  con infección por SARS-CoV-2 confirmada por PCR (n = 694) tras un periodo entre  4,7 y 24 meses desde el diagnóstico y sus contactos estrechos (n = 663),  obtenidos por muestreo aleatorio simple a partir de 47.773 casos y 94.301  contactos. Se utilizó la encuesta ISARIC, estableciéndose como variable  resultado principal la respuesta «no-sentirse completamente recuperado (NSCR)». RESULTADOS: El 16,57% (n = 115/694) declararon NSCR. Los síntomas más  prevalentes fueron, por orden de frecuencia: fatiga (54,8%), pérdida del olfato  (40,9%), problemas para hablar o comunicarse (29,6%), pérdida del gusto (28,7%),  confusión/falta de concentración (27,8%), dolor muscular persistente (24,3%) y  dificultad para respirar/falta de aire (23,5%). Al comparar los tres grupos  ordinales (contactos estrechos, COVID-19 recuperados y COVID-19 NSCR), la  prevalencia de estos síntomas fue mayor en cada grupo (p < 0,001). El sexo  femenino se asoció significativamente con NSCR: Odds Ratio ajustada  (aOR) = 1,56), así como la edad avanzada: aOR por cada 10 años = 1,15. Por  último, obtuvieron en Euroquol una puntuación media de 9,63 puntos menos. CONCLUSIONES: Más del 15% de los pacientes reportaron NSCR, siendo el sexo  femenino y la edad factores predictores independientes. La mayoría de los  síntomas en estos pacientes coincidieron con los de la definición de condición  post-COVID-19 de la OMS y fueron menos prevalentes en contactos estrechos y  COVID-19 que se sintieron recuperados, con un patrón dosis respuesta, y con una  menor calidad de vida según Euroquol.  © 2024 Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica (SEPAR).

Tracey AJ(1), Loftin MC(1), Zynda AJ(2), Pollard-McGrandy AM(1), Klein LA(1),  Covassin T(1).  Author information: (1)1Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan; and. (2)2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  OBJECTIVE: While the clinical presentations of COVID-19 and concussion are not  identical, there is a significant overlap in symptomology (e.g., fatigue,  headache) and neurological deficits (e.g., cognitive, vestibular). However,  limited research has examined the effect of prior COVID-19 diagnosis on  concussion outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if  prior diagnosis of COVID-19 influences concussion outcomes, including concussion  assessment scores and recovery time, in college-aged individuals. METHODS: A prospective study of college-aged individuals (COVID-19: n = 43, mean  age 21.3 [SD 2.5] years; no COVID-19: n = 51, mean age 21.0 [SD 2.5] years)  diagnosed with concussion was conducted. Demographics, injury details, the Sport  Concussion Assessment Tool 5th Edition (SCAT5), and the Vestibular/Ocular Motor  Screening (VOMS) were completed at the acute (within 5 days after concussion)  and full medical clearance (FMC) (within 3 days after FMC) visits. Mann-Whitney  U-tests determined differences in concussion outcomes between groups. Cox  proportional hazards regression models were fitted to assess the relationship  between factors associated with concussion symptom resolution and days to FMC,  and covariates were selected based on previous literature indicating potential  confounds (e.g., female sex, acute symptom severity, preexisting mental health  conditions). Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported for each  predictor variable. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between groups for SCAT5 and VOMS  composite and total scores. Significant differences were found between COVID-19  and no-COVID-19 groups in days to symptom resolution (11.5 days vs 8 days, p =  0.021), but not in days to FMC (14 days vs 12 days, p = 0.099). The association  between COVID-19 groups and days to clearance was not significant when adjusting  for sex, race, history of depression/anxiety, and total number of concussion  symptoms at the acute visit [χ2(5) = 8.349, p = 0.138]. However, male sex (HR  2.036, 95% CI 1.033-4.014; p = 0.040) was associated with a quicker time to FMC. CONCLUSIONS: Prior COVID-19 diagnosis did not influence cognitive abilities and  vestibular/ocular functioning as measured by the SCAT5 and VOMS postconcussion.  While prior COVID-19 diagnosis did result in a significantly longer duration to  symptom resolution when compared with individuals who did not have a prior  COVID-19 diagnosis, prior COVID-19 did not significantly influence time to FMC  by a healthcare provider. Clinicians should consider that individuals with a  prior diagnosis of COVID-19 might experience prolonged symptoms postconcussion.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  frequently coexist, significantly impacting health-related quality of life  (HRQoL). This study evaluated HRQoL in patients with CHF, COPD, or both, three  months post-COVID-19 discharge using EQ-5D and KCCQ questionnaires to guide  targeted healthcare interventions. We conducted a cross-sectional study at  ""Victor Babes"" Hospital in Timisoara, enrolling 180 patients who had recovered  from COVID-19 (60 in each group including CHF, COPD, and both conditions). HRQoL  was assessed via EQ-5D and KCCQ. Significant disparities in HRQoL measures were  noted across the groups. Patients with both CHF and COPD reported the worst  outcomes, especially in terms of hospital stay lengths due to COVID-19 (11.63  days) and initial oxygen saturation levels (88.7%). HRQoL improvements from  discharge to three months post-discharge were significant, with EQ-5D mobility  scores improving notably across all groups (CHF and COPD: 2.87 to 2.34, p =  0.010). KCCQ results reflected substantial enhancements in physical limitation  (CHF and COPD: 38.94 to 58.54, p = 0.001) and quality of life scores (CHF and  COPD: 41.38 to 61.92, p = 0.0031). Regression analysis revealed that dual  diagnosis (CHF and COPD) significantly impacted usual activities and quality of  life (β = -0.252, p = 0.048; β = -0.448, p = 0.017), whereas the initial  severity of COVID-19 was a significant predictor of worse HRQoL outcomes (β =  -0.298, p = 0.037; β = -0.342, p = 0.024). The presence of both CHF and COPD in  patients recovering from COVID-19 was associated with more severe HRQoL  impairment compared with either condition alone. These findings emphasize the  need for specialized, comprehensive post-COVID-19 recovery programs that address  the complex interplay among chronic conditions to optimize patient outcomes and  enhance quality of life.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) encompasses long-lasting  symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 and is estimated to affect between 31-67%  of patients, with women being more commonly affected. No definitive biomarkers  have emerged in the acute stage that can help predict the onset of PCC,  therefore we aimed at describing sex-disaggregated data of PCC patients from a  local cohort and explore potential acute predictors of PCC and neurologic PCC. METHODS: A local cohort of consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnosis  between June 2020 and July 2021 were registered, and clinical and laboratory  data were recorded. Only those <65 years, discharged alive and followed up at 6  and 12 months after admission were considered in these analyses. Multivariable  logistic regression analysis was performed to explore variables associated with  PCC (STATA v 18.0). RESULTS: From 130 patients in the cohort, 104 were contacted: 30% were women,  median age of 42 years. At 6 months, 71 (68%) reported PCC symptoms. Women  exhibited a higher prevalence of any PCC symptom (87 vs. 60%, p = 0.007), lower  ferritin (p = 0.001) and procalcitonin (p = 0.021) and higher TNF levels  (p = 0.042) in the acute phase compared to men. Being women was independently  associated to 7.60 (95% CI 1.27-45.18, p = 0.026) higher risk for PCC. Moreover,  women had lower return to normal activities 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the lasting impact of COVID-19, particularly  in young women, emphasising the need for tailored post-COVID care. The lower  ferritin levels in women are an intriguing observation, warranting further  research. The study argues for comprehensive strategies that address  sex-specific challenges in recovery from COVID-19.

However, the literature on post-COVID-19 symptoms  reveals conflicting results, necessitating a heightened focus on longitudinal  studies to comprehend the trajectory of impairments over time. Our study aimed  to investigate changes in long-term impairments among individuals infected with  COVID-19 and explore potential predictors influencing these changes. METHODS: We conducted a web-survey targeting individuals that had been infected  with COVID-19 at four time-points: T0 (baseline), T1 (three months), T2 (six  months), and T3 (twelve months). The survey included contextual factors, factors  related to body functions and structures, and post-COVID impairments. The  longitudinal sample included 213 individuals (with a mean age of 48.92 years).  Linear mixed models were employed to analyze changes in post-COVID impairments  over time and identify impacting factors. RESULTS: Findings revealed a general decline in post-COVID impairments over  time, with each symptom exhibiting a dynamic pattern of fluctuations. Factors  such as initial infection severity, education level, and work status were  significantly associated with the levels of impairments. DISCUSSION: The study emphasizes that post-COVID impairments are not static but  exhibit variations over time. Personalized care, especially for vulnerable  populations, is crucial. The results underscore the need for long-term  monitoring and multidisciplinary treatment approaches. Targeted support and  interventions are highlighted for individuals with severe initial infections and  those in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are the most common cause of death after  surgery. This study aimed to derive and externally validate a novel prognostic  model that can be used before elective surgery to estimate the risk of  postoperative pulmonary complications and to support resource allocation and  prioritisation during pandemic recovery. METHODS: Data from an international, prospective cohort study were used to  develop a novel prognostic risk model for pulmonary complications after elective  surgery in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) across all operation and disease  types. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at  30 days after surgery, which was a composite of pneumonia, acute respiratory  distress syndrome, and unexpected mechanical ventilation. Model development with  candidate predictor variables was done in the GlobalSurg-CovidSurg Week dataset  (global; October, 2020). Two structured machine learning techniques were  explored (XGBoost and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  [LASSO]), and the model with the best performance (GSU-Pulmonary Score)  underwent internal validation using bootstrap resampling. The discrimination and  calibration of the score were externally validated in two further prospective  cohorts: CovidSurg-Cancer (worldwide; February to August, 2020, during the  COVID-19 pandemic) and RECON (UK and Australasia; January to October, 2019,  before the COVID-19 pandemic). The model was deployed as an online web  application. The GlobalSurg-CovidSurg Week and CovidSurg-Cancer studies were  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04509986 and NCT04384926. FINDINGS: Prognostic models were developed from 13 candidate predictor variables  in data from 86 231 patients (1158 hospitals in 114 countries). External  validation included 30 492 patients from CovidSurg-Cancer (726 hospitals in 75  countries) and 6789 from RECON (150 hospitals in three countries). The overall  rates of pulmonary complications were 2·0% in derivation data, and 3·9%  (CovidSurg-Cancer) and 4·7% (RECON) in the validation datasets. Penalised  regression using LASSO had similar discrimination to XGBoost (area under the  receiver operating curve [AUROC] 0·786, 95% CI 0·774-0·798 vs 0·785,  0·772-0·797), was more explainable, and required fewer covariables. The final  GSU-Pulmonary Score included ten predictor variables and showed good  discrimination and calibration upon internal validation (AUROC 0·773, 95% CI  0·751-0·795; Brier score 0·020, calibration in the large [CITL] 0·034, slope  0·954). The model performance was acceptable on external validation in  CovidSurg-Cancer (AUROC 0·746, 95% CI 0·733-0·760; Brier score 0·036, CITL  0·109, slope 1·056), but with some miscalibration in RECON data (AUROC 0·716,  95% CI 0·689-0·744; Brier score 0·045, CITL 1·040, slope 1·009). INTERPRETATION: This novel prognostic risk score uses simple predictor variables  available at the time of a decision for elective surgery that can accurately  stratify patients' risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including  during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. It could inform surgical consent, resource  allocation, and hospital-level prioritisation as elective surgery is upscaled to  address global backlogs.

OBJECTIVE: To describe hand grip strength, walking speed, functional mobility,  and postural control at one year following intensive care unit admission for  COVID-19, and to find any predictors that are associated with impaired hand grip  strength, walking speed, functional mobility, or postural control at the 1-year  follow-up. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Intensive care unit and outpatient research clinic at Sahlgrenska  University Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 105 individuals in ""The Gothenburg Recovery and  Rehabilitation after COVID-19 and Intensive Care Unit"" cohort, 78 participated  in this study. MAIN MEASURES: Descriptive statistics for hand grip strength, walking speed,  functional mobility, and postural control were presented and binary logistic  regressions were performed to find their significant predictors. RESULTS: At 1-year following intensive care unit admission for COVID-19,  impaired hand grip strength was found in 24.4% for the right hand and 23.1% for  the left hand. Walking speed, functional mobility, and postural control were  found to be impaired in 29.5%, 21.8%, and 5.1%, respectively. For impaired  walking speed, longer length of stay at intensive care unit and presence of  diabetes mellitus were risk factors. Diabetes mellitus was found to be the risk  factor for impaired functional mobility. CONCLUSION: In this study, 45% of the participants showed impairment in  function, activity capacity or both. These results suggest that individuals who  recovered after intensive care unit admission for COVID-19 would benefit from  receiving long-term follow-up to enable identification of those with need of  physical health assistance and rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on post-severe COVID-19 functional trajectory,  particularly considering premorbid status. We characterized 1-year functional  recovery post-hospitalization for COVID-19, highlighting predictors of long-term  recovery. METHODS: We enrolled adult patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and  hospitalized for COVID-19 sequelae, from five major Ontario, Canada hospitals in  a prospective cohort study. Assessments included telephone interviews on  admission followed by telephone and in-person assessments at 3-, 6-, 9-, and  12-months post-discharge. The Activity-Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)  Mobility and Cognition scales were administered at baseline and every 3 months  for 1 year. Secondary outcomes included symptoms, spirometry, physical  performance, dyspnea, fatigue, distress, anxiety and depression, and quality of  life. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (57.1% male) with a mean age of 60.0 (±13.1)  years and an average hospital stay of 14.3 (±19.7) days agreed to participate.  At 12 months, 55.3% demonstrated clinically important deficits in mobility and  38.8% had cognitive deficits compared to premorbid levels. Fatigue was reported  in 44.2%, followed by difficulty walking long distances in 35.8% and dyspnea in  33.0%. Almost 40% of patients had an FEV1(% Pred) < 80% at 12 months, 60.3% had  impairments in physical performance, and 44.5% had problems with anxiety or  depression. Predictors of better mobility at 12 months included higher premorbid  mobility status, male sex, shorter hospital stay, fewer comorbidities, and  higher FEV1 (% pred) at the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides compelling evidence of the long-term impact of  COVID-19 on functional and cognitive status 1-year post-infection.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review findings from a large prospective  national database of chemosensory disturbances associated with coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. DATA SOURCES: The Virginia Commonwealth University Smell and Taste Center  national database of COVID-19 chemosensory disturbances. METHODS: A series of online surveys, first opened on April 10, 2020, was made  accessible nationwide to any adult with sudden chemosensory dysfunction since  January 2020. Participants received subsequent follow-up surveys 14 days, 1  month, 3 months, and 6 months after enrollment. An additional survey was sent to  all participants on May 28, 2022 to assess long-term outcomes. Information  pertaining to demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, treatments, and life impact  was collected. RESULTS: Of 363 participants who reported complete smell recovery, 51.2%  recovered within 1 month, 70% within 3 months, and 79% within 6 months, while  8.8% took over 1 year to completely recover. Among all participants, 7.5% had no  smell recovery. Positive predictors of recovery included age <40, male gender,  and the presence of nasal congestion. Negative predictors included difficulty  breathing and prior head injury. Many participants reported a decrease in  quality of life and the presence of potential safety hazards associated with  decreased smell loss. CONCLUSIONS: Most subjects with COVID-19-related chemosensory dysfunction  recover, with the majority noting complete recovery within weeks of infection.  Those aged over 40 years and female gender were associated with lower rates of  recovery. A considerable number of participants reported significant impact on  quality of life and safety.  © 2024 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relative efficacy of  medications used following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2) infection on self-reported alterations in taste and/or smell  function. METHODS: Seven hundred and fourteen persons with self-reported postcoronavirus  disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) chemosensory disorders were personally interviewed  regarding specific medications they were administered following the acute phase  of the disease. The dependent measure-self-reported total recovery of  chemosensory symptoms-was subjected to stepwise logistic regression. Independent  predictors included demographic and clinical variables, in addition to specific  medications used to mitigate disease symptoms (i.e., systemic corticosteroids,  oseltamivir, vitamin C, ibuprofen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin,  nitazoxanide, anticoagulants, and zinc). RESULTS: The median time between COVID-19 symptom onset and the interviews was  81 days (interquartile range: 60-104). Of the 714 subjects, 249 (34.9%) reported  total recovery of their chemosensory function; 437 (61.2%) had at least one  treatment since the beginning of the disease. Women and those with more  comorbidities had undergone more treatments. The recovery rates of the treated  and nontreated groups did not differ significantly. Nonetheless, respondents who  had used nitazoxanide tended to have a higher rate of self-reported taste or  smell recovery. Those who took oral zinc were less likely to improve. CONCLUSIONS: No medication employed during the first months after SARS-CoV-2  infection had a clear positive effect on returning self-reported smell or taste  function to normal, although nitrazoxide trended in a positive direction. Oral  zinc had a negative effect on the reported recovery of these senses.  © 2024 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Studies exploring the effect of COVID-19 on male reproductive system  suggest a detrimental association, however with conflicting results. The aim of  this study was to assess the association between COVID-19 infection and male  reproductive potential including hormone profiles and semen parameters. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 48 patients with confirmed  COVID-19 infection. Patients were subdivided into an asymptomatic group (n = 30)  and a group with COVID-19 symptoms (n = 18). Serum hormone levels including  testosterone, LH, FSH and estradiol were collected during active infection  (baseline, time 0), and at 3 and 6 months following COVID-19 infection. Semen  samples (basic semen analysis and oxidation reduction potential) were examined  at 3 and 6 months following infection. Student and paired-t tests were used to  compare continuous variables between the study groups and across the studied  time intervals, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis  was performed to explore predictors for COVID-19 symptoms during active  infection. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 symptoms were significantly older (p = 0.02) and  had significantly lower serum testosterone levels (p = 0.01) and significantly  higher LH: testosterone ratio (p = 0.01) than asymptomatic patients.  Multivariate analysis revealed older age (OR =  1.18, p = 0.03) and lower serum  testosterone level (OR = 0.8, p = 0.03) as independent predictors of symptomatic  COVID-19 infection. Significant increase in testosterone (p < 0.001 for both)  and decrease in LH (p = 0.02, p = 0.007) and LH: testosterone (p = 0.02,  p = 0.005) levels were observed at 3 and 6 months in patients with COVID-19  symptoms. Asymptomatic patients demonstrated significant increase in  testosterone (p = 0.02) and decrease in LH: testosterone (p = 0.04) levels only  at 3 months following COVID-19 infection. No significant differences were  observed between the two study groups with regards to the semen analysis results  obtained at 3 or 6 months following COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Significantly lower testosterone values are associated with worse  disease severity among men with COVID-19 infection. This association appears to  be temporary as a significant increase in testosterone levels are witnessed as  early as 3 months following recovery. No significant detrimental effect for  COVID-19 infection on testicular sperm production is found in this patient  population.  © 2024 Majzoub, Khalafalla, Arafa, El Ansari, Nair, Al Bishawi, Saleh, Khair  Ella, ElBardisi, Khattab and AlRumaihi.

BACKGROUND: High concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme receptors in the  proximal tubules make kidneys an early target in COVID-19. Proximal tubular  dysfunction (PTD) may act as an early predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI) and  more severe disease. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the COVID unit,  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. 87 COVID-19 patients without known  kidney disease were screened for 6 markers of PTD on admission-hyperuricosuria,  normoglycemic glycosuria, proteinuria, renal phosphate leak, sodium leak and  potassium leak. Positivity of 2 of the first 4 markers was considered as PTD. 35  patients with PTD and 35 without PTD were followed up throughout their hospital  stay. RESULTS: 52.9% had PTD on admission. The most prevalent markers were renal  sodium leak (67%), followed by proteinuria (66.7%), hyperuricosuria (42.5%),  potassium leak (32.2%), phosphate leak (28.7%) and normoglycemic glycosuria  (20.7%). Mean age was 55.7 years. 32.9% patients developed AKI. PTD group had  higher odds of developing AKI (odds ratio 17.5 for stage 1, 24.8 for stage 2 and  25.5 for stage 3; p<0.0001). The mean duration of hospital stay was 9 days  higher in the PTD group (p<0.001). PTD group also had higher odds of  transferring to ICU (OR = 9.4, p = 0.002), need for mechanical ventilation (OR =  10.1, p = 0.002) and death (OR = 10.3, p = 0.001). 32.6% had complete PTD  recovery during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Proximal tubular dysfunction is highly prevalent in COVID-19  patients very early in the disease and may act as a predictor of AKI, ICU  transfer, need for mechanical ventilation and death.

Electronic address: Jean.Dubuisson@hcuge.ch.  BACKGROUND: Outpatient surgery in gynaecology may offer advantages including  cost reduction, patient convenience and hospital bed optimisation without  compromising patient safety and satisfaction. With the continual rise in health  costs since 2000, outpatient surgery could be a line of action to improve  financial resource utilisation and a solution for continuing to treat patients  during crises such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review provides an overview of the literature on  minimally invasive outpatient hysterectomy for benign indications. METHOD: A focused systematic review of the medical literature between 2018 and  2022 on outpatient gynaecological surgery for a benign indication was conducted  using the PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. We then narrowed our  selection to articles that referred to hysterectomy. Successful same-day  discharge (SDD) was defined as the patient's return home on the day of the  procedure without an overnight stay. RESULTS: Fifteen articles that focused on minimally invasive surgery were  included in this review. Most of the studies (n = 11) were conducted in the  United States. Outpatient surgery had a mean success rate of 60 % and a mean  readmission rate of 3 %. The main reasons for SDD failure were patient choice,  failed voiding, the need for pain management, nausea or vomiting, or both and  the late timing of surgery. SDD was not associated with more complications and  readmissions compared with inpatient care. The three main attribute predictors  of SDD were young age, early timing of surgery and short total operative time.  Patient satisfaction with SDD was high in absolute terms and relative to  satisfaction with hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive outpatient hysterectomy for a benign indication  is feasible and safe but is associated with a notable risk of failure. To  increase the success rate of outpatient management, patients must be well  selected and surgery pathways must be planned in advance. The implementation of  enhanced recovery protocols may help promote outpatient hysterectomy for a  benign indication.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Whether long coronavirus disease (long COVID) affects the  kidneys remains to be understood. In this scoping review, we described the  evidence of renal long COVID. STUDY DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted according to the Joanna Briggs  Institute and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses  extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and other  databases from inception until February 2025. SETTING & STUDY POPULATIONS: We included evidence on kidney-related outcomes in  adult survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with data on long COVID. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Cohorts from all settings. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data related to longitudinal kidney outcomes. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Data were synthesized and presented in tables and figures. RESULTS: We screened 6,203 studies and included 37 in this review (38 reports),  comprising 1,308,265 individuals with follow-up data. The majority were  retrospective (61%) and from Europe (37%). All reports included hospitalized  patients and 34% also included the community setting. Acute kidney injury (AKI)  during acute COVID-19 phase was assessed in 58% of the reports. Chronic kidney  disease (CKD) development was assessed in 29% of the reports, with wide  variation in its frequency, ranging from 0.4%-45%. Progression of CKD (7  studies, 18%) ranged from 8%-49%. Studies reporting higher frequencies of AKI  found larger rates of renal long COVID. Overall, there was high heterogeneity in  how kidney-related outcomes were reported during follow-up. Most studies  presented data on crude kidney function biomarkers (eg, serum creatinine or  estimated glomerular filtration rate), while a few (13%) reported major adverse  kidney events. Data on proteinuria or urinary biomarkers were scarce. LIMITATIONS: Lack of studies with pre-COVID-19 data. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review highlighted that renal long COVID,  characterized by CKD development and/or progression, may occur. Available  evidence suggests that AKI may be associated with renal long COVID. Therefore,  long-term kidney function monitoring is advisable after COVID-19 recovery to  enable early diagnosis and timely intervention for CKD.  Plain Language Summary: Kidney complications may persist after coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovery, but their long-term impact remains unclear.  Our review analyzed data from over 1 million patients and found that those who  experienced acute kidney injury during COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing  or worsening chronic kidney disease. However, the studies showed significant  variation in how often renal long COVID occurred, highlighting the need for more  research. Given these findings, regular kidney function monitoring after  COVID-19 recovery is essential for early detection and intervention to prevent  long-term complications. This study underscores the importance of recognizing  renal long COVID as a potential consequence in the post-COVID era.  © 2025 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Children are at increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders  following COVID-19. However, information regarding the clinical, metabolic, and  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics in patients with neuropsychiatric  disorders associated with COVID-19 is limited. In this study, we described the  clinical features and retrospectively assessed the metabolic and inflammatory  profiles of 13 pediatric patients who exhibited subacute neuropsychiatric  symptoms within one month of SARS-CoV-2 infection (NP-COVID-19). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the clinical and paraclinical  data of 13 children with NP-COVID-19 admitted to Qilu hospital from December 15,  2022, to January 31, 2023. Healthy children (HC, n = 21) and pre-pandemic  migraine patients (n = 12) were included as controls. Systemic metabolic and  inflammatory parameters in NP-COVID-19 patients including thyroid hormone levels  and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were compared with HC. Blood-brain barrier  (BBB) integrity and CSF biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation including  cytokines and immunoglobulin G index were compared with migraine patients. RESULTS: CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative in all patients with NP-COVID-19. No  differences in systemic inflammatory parameters were found between NP-COVID-19  patients and HC. However, NP-COVID-19 patients with intact BBB integrity  exhibited significantly higher CSF interleukin (IL)-8 levels than migraine  controls. In addition, serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were lower in  NP-COVID-19 patients than HC and low-T3 syndrome occurred in 61.5% of  NP-COVID-19 children. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation rarely occurred in children with NP-COVID-19.  Low-T3 syndrome is prevalent in NP-COVID-19 pediatric patients and the  neuroinflammatory activation is mainly characterized by elevated CSF IL-8.  Further study is required to investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms in  NP-COVID-19.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Long-term sequelae of COVID-19 remain critical public health concerns, with  limited therapeutic options available. We conducted two case-control studies  among COVID-19 infected individuals in the UK Biobank to explore the association  of sociodemographic factors, clinical biomarkers, and comorbidities with the  risk of two key phenotypes: Long COVID (LC, defined by patient self-report  symptoms) and post-acute complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PACS, defined by  clinical diagnosis), separately. Our study included 8,668 participants in the LC  cohort (32% classified as cases) and 108,407 in the PACS cohort (with 2% being  cases). Findings showed that age and sex were associated with both LC and PACS  but in opposite directions. Additionally, obesity, socioeconomic deprivation,  elevated C-reactive protein, triglyceride, vitamin D, HbA1c, cystatin C, urate,  and alanine aminotransferase, and decreased HDL cholesterol and IGF-1, as well  as CKD and COPD, were associated with LC. Most of these factors were also  significant for PACS, except for alanine aminotransferase and vitamin D. These  findings have potential mechanistic implications for the distinction between LC  and PACS and can guide clinical implementation of identifying high-risk groups  for targeted vaccination or other public health mitigation strategies.  © 2025.

Two neurocognitive domains identified for patients with myalgic  encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.  Sandoval A(1), Li M(1), Jason LA(1).  Author information: (1)Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States.  Patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and  Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) often have neurocognitive complaints that  involve memory and concentration problems and difficulties paying attention.  Other neurocognitive domains such as hypersensitivity to noise and light have  rarely been included as aspects of neurocognitive impairment for these  post-viral conditions. The current study evaluated a more extensive list of  neurocognitive items for a group of 2,313 patients with ME/CFS and 299 patients  with PASC. Exploratory factor analyses found two factors for each patient group,  one involving classic memory and concentration symptoms and the other involving  sensory overload phenomena. The findings suggest that researchers might consider  expanding the types of self-report neurocognitive symptoms among patients with  these post-viral illnesses.

Narrative review synthesizes the most current literature on the SARS-CoV-2 XEC  variant, focusing on its genomic evolution, immune evasion characteristics,  epidemiological dynamics, and public health implications. To achieve this, we  conducted a structured search of the literature of peer-reviewed articles,  preprints, and official surveillance data from 2023 to early 2025, prioritizing  virological, clinical, and immunological reports related to XEC and its parent  lineages. Defined by the distinctive spike protein mutations, T22N and Q493E,  XEC exhibits modest reductions in neutralization in vitro, although current  evidence suggests that mRNA booster vaccines, including those targeting JN.1 and  KP.2, retain cross-protective efficacy against symptomatic and severe disease.  The XEC strain of SARS-CoV-2 has drawn particular attention due to its  increasing prevalence in multiple regions and its potential to displace other  Omicron subvariants, although direct evidence of enhanced replicative fitness is  currently lacking. Preliminary analyses also indicated that glycosylation  changes at the N-terminal domain enhance infectivity and immunological evasion,  which is expected to underpin the increasing prevalence of XEC. The XEC variant,  while still emerging, is marked by a unique recombination pattern and a set of  spike protein mutations (T22N and Q493E) that collectively demonstrate increased  immune evasion potential and epidemiological expansion across Europe and North  America. Current evidence does not conclusively associate XEC with greater  disease severity, although additional research is required to determine its  clinical relevance. Key knowledge gaps include the precise role of recombination  events in XEC evolution and the duration of cross-protective T-cell responses.  New research priorities include genomic surveillance in undersampled regions,  updated vaccine formulations against novel spike epitopes, and long-term  longitudinal studies to monitor post-acute sequelae. These efforts can be  augmented by computational modeling and the One Health approach, which combines  human and veterinary sciences. Recent computational findings (GISAID, 2024)  point to the potential of XEC for further mutations in under-surveilled  reservoirs, enhancing containment challenges and risks. Addressing the potential  risks associated with the XEC variant is expected to benefit from  interdisciplinary coordination, particularly in regions where genomic  surveillance indicates a measurable increase in prevalence.

(#)Contributed equally  Severe symptoms in the absence of measurable body pathology are a frequent  hallmark of post-COVID syndrome. From a Bayesian Brain perspective, such  symptoms can be explained by incorrect internal models that the brain uses to  interpret sensory signals. In this pre-registered study, we investigate whether  induced breathlessness perception during a controlled CO2rebreathing challenge  is reflected by altered respiratory measures (physiology and breathing  patterns), and propose different computational mechanisms that could explain our  findings in a Bayesian Brain framework. We analysed data from 40 patients with  post-COVID syndrome and 40 healthy participants. Results from lung function,  neurological and neurocognitive examination of all participants were within  normal limits on the day of the experiment. Using a Bayesian repeated-measures  ANOVA, we found that patients' breathlessness was strongly increased  (BF10,baseline=8.029, BF10,rebreathing=11636, BF10,recovery=43662) compared to  controls. When excluding patients who hyperventilated (N = 8, 20%) during the  experiment from the analysis, differences in breathlessness remained  (BF10,baseline=1.283, BF10,rebreathing=126.812, BF10,recovery=751.282). For  physiology and breathing patterns, all evidence pointed towards no difference  between the two groups (0.307 > BF10 < 0.704). In summary, we found intact  breathing patterns and physiology but increased symptom perception in patients  with post-COVID syndrome.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Background/Objectives: The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia,  particularly the persistence of imaging abnormalities and their relationship to  clinical symptoms, remain unclear. While the acute radiologic patterns are  well-documented, the transition to chronic pulmonary changes-and their  implications for long COVID symptoms-require systematic investigation. Methods:  Our study included 93 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia who  were admitted to Istanbul Medical Faculty Hospital, each having one follow-up CT  scan over a ten-month period. Two thoracic radiologists independently calculated  semi-quantitative initial chest CT scores to evaluate lung involvement in  pneumonia (0-5 per lobe, total score 0-25). Two radiologists and one  pulmonologist retrospectively examined the persistence of follow-up imaging  findings, interpreting them alongside the relevant clinical and laboratory data.  Additionally, in a subcohort (n = 46), mid-term (5-7 months) and long-term (≥10  months) scans were compared to assess temporal trajectories. Results: Among the  93 patients with long-term follow-up imaging, non-fibrotic changes persisted in  34 scans (36.6%), while fibrotic-like changes were observed in 70 scans (75.3%).  The most common persistent non-fibrotic changes were heterogeneous attenuation  (29%, n = 27) and ground-glass opacities (17.2%, n = 16), and the persistent  fibrotic-like changes were pleuroparenchymal bands or linear atelectasis (58%, n  = 54), fine reticulation (52.6%, n = 49), and subpleural curvilinear lines  (34.4%, n = 32). Both persistent non-fibrotic and fibrotic-like changes were  statistically correlated with the initial CT score (p < 0.001), LDH (p < 0.001),  and ferritin levels (p = 0.008 and p = 0.003, respectively). Fatigue (p = 0.025)  and chest pain (p < 0.001) were reported more frequently in patients with  persistent non-fibrotic changes, while chest pain (p = 0.033) was reported more  frequently among those with persistent fibrotic-like changes. Among the 46  patients who underwent both mid- and long-term follow-up imaging, 47.2% of those  with non-fibrotic changes (17 out of 36) and 10% of those with fibrotic-like  changes (4 out of 40) exhibited regression over the long term. Conclusions:  Initial imaging and laboratory findings may indicate persistent imaging findings  related to long-term sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia. Many of these persistent  imaging abnormalities, particularly non-fibrotic changes seen in the mid-term,  tend to lessen over the long term. A correlation exists between persistent  imaging findings and clinical outcomes of long COVID-19, underscoring the need  for further research.

We aim to evaluate  whether alterations in poorly studied hemostatic and endothelial proteins are  associated with CVEs in patients previously admitted to the ICU and evaluated  one year post-discharge. We carried out a cross-sectional study involving 63  COVID-19 patients previously admitted to the ICU one year post-discharge. Plasma  levels of factor IX (coagulation factor), protein C, protein S (natural  anticoagulant), and von Willebrand factor (VWF, an endothelial marker) were  measured using a Luminex 200™ analyzer. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were  used to assess the association of these coagulation proteins with CVEs and  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). We found that lower  levels of factor IX (p = 0.011), protein C (p = 0.028), and protein S (p =  0.008) were associated with CVEs one year after ICU discharge. Additionally, at  the one-year follow-up, we found lower levels of factor IX (p = 0.002) and  higher levels of VWF (p = 0.006) associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP,  underscoring the involvement of both hemostatic imbalance and persistent  endothelial dysfunction. Our findings revealed a gender-specific pattern of  associations with NT-proBNP levels. These findings highlight the significant  role of persistent hemostatic imbalance and endothelial dysfunction in the  development of cardiovascular abnormalities among COVID-19 survivors discharged  from the ICU.

The COVID-19-related long-standing effect or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19  (PASC) is often associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation in pulmonary  inflammation elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Spike proteins engage  toll-like receptors (TLRs) in respiratory epithelial cells, leading to excessive  cytokine production. Given the need for effective therapeutic strategies to  mitigate spike protein-stimulated lung inflammation, we examined the  anti-inflammatory properties of luteolin and ethanolic extract from Harrisonia  perforata (Blanco) Merr. root. The ethanolic extract of H. perforata root (HPEE)  contained a high concentration of luteolin flavonoid (143.53 ± 1.58 mg/g  extract). Both HPEE (25-100 μg/mL) and luteolin (4.5-36 μM) significantly  inhibited inflammation stimulated by the Wuhan (W) and Omicron (O) spike protein  S1, as evidenced by a dose-dependent significant decrease in IL-6, IL-1β, and  IL-18 secretion in A549 lung epithelial cells (p < 0.05). Furthermore,  pretreatment with HPEE or luteolin prior to spike protein exposure (100 ng/mL)  significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, repressed the inflammatory mRNA  expression (p < 0.05). Mechanistic study revealed that HPEE and luteolin  suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome signaling activation by reducing their machinery  protein expressions. Additionally, they inhibited the ERK/JNK/p38 MAPK signaling  activation, resulting in decreased inflammatory mRNA expression and cytokine  release. These findings suggest that H. perforata root extract and its major  flavonoid luteolin exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and may offer  therapeutic potential against spike protein-induced lung inflammation.

Defibrotide, which is approved for treating hepatic veno-occlusive disease  (VOD)/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), exhibits pleiotropic  anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and fibrinolytic properties, conferring  broad endothelial protective effects. Given these mechanisms, defibrotide has  potential utility in various conditions involving endothelial injury or  activation. In this review we outline the endothelial-protective mechanisms of  defibrotide and comprehensively summarize current evidence supporting its  applications in hematologic malignancies, including the prevention and treatment  of hepatic VOD/SOS, graft-versus-host disease, and transplant-associated  thrombotic microangiopathy. Additionally, we discuss its role in mitigating key  toxicities linked to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and  bispecific antibodies, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune  effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). We also explore  emerging evidence on defibrotide's potential in SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated  endotheliopathies, including acute COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of  SARS-CoV-2 infection (""long-COVID""), and the endothelial protective activity of  defibrotide in these settings. Finally, we highlight potential future  applications of defibrotide in hematologic malignancies and viral infections,  emphasizing its multimodal mechanism of action.

While there are many postulates for the etiology of post-viral chronic fatigue  and other symptomatology, little is known. We draw on our past experience of  these syndromes to devise means which can expose the primary players of this  malady in terms of a panoply participating biomolecules and the state of the  stool microbiome. Using databases established from a large dataset of patients  at risk of colorectal cancer who were followed longitudinally over 3 decades,  and a smaller database dedicated to building a Long PASC cohort (Post-Acute  Sequelae of COVID-19), we were able to ascertain factors that predisposed  patients to (and resulted in) significant changes in various biomarkers, i.e.,  the stool microbiome and serum cytokine levels, which we verified by collecting  stool and serum samples. There were significant changes in the stool microbiome  with an inversion from the usual Bacillota and Bacteroidota species. Serum  cytokines showed significant differences in MIP-1β versus TARC (CC chemokine  ligand 17) in patients with either PASC or COVID-19 (p < 0.02); IL10 versus  IL-12p70a (p < 0.02); IL-1b versus IL-6 (p < 0.01); MCP1 versus TARC (p < 0.03);  IL-8 versus TARC (p < 0.002); and Eotaxin3 versus TARC (p < 0.004) in PASC. Some  changes were seen solely in COVID-19, including MDC versus MIP-1α (p < 0.01);  TNF-α versus IL-1-β (p < 0.06); MCP4 versus TARC (p < 0.0001). We also show  correlates with chronic fatigue where an etiology was not identified. These  findings in patients with positive criteria for PASC show profound changes in  the microbiome and serum cytokine expression. Patients with chronic fatigue  without clear viral etiologies also have common associations, including a  history of tonsillectomy, which evokes a likely immune etiology.

(#)Contributed equally  Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), commonly known as long COVID, presents with  a broad spectrum of medical conditions and symptoms persisting beyond 3 months  post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting over 18 million Americans and 65 million  people worldwide. Despite its prevalence, to date, there are no specific  clinical guidelines for the perioperative management of PASC patients. PASC is a  complex, multisystemic condition leading to neurological, respiratory, and  endocrine sequelae, potentially resulting from persistent viral presence, immune  dysregulation, and/or end-organ damage. This manuscript discusses the  implications of these sequelae on anesthesia practice, emphasizing the need for  vigilance in pre-operative assessments to identify PASC and associated  conditions through detailed patient history, understanding of off-label  medication use, and familiarity with medical terminologies like POTS, MCAS, and  brain fog. Key perioperative considerations include cautious use of anesthetics,  especially in patients with neurological and cardiovascular complications.  Pulmonary management strategies for PASC patients, such as lung-protective  ventilation and non-invasive post-operative support, could mitigate any  perioperative respiratory complications. Finally, we underscore the importance  of a multidisciplinary approach to manage PASC patients effectively during  surgery, advocating for personalized anesthetic plans and calling for more  evidence-driven guidelines for this emerging patient group as research  progresses.  © 2025.

Endothelial damage represents an essential pathogenic mechanism of respiratory  and multiorgan dysfunction as seen in the post-acute phase of COVID-19.  Biological differences between male and female sex, inflammation, and gut  integrity may have an integral role in endothelial damage and explain the  residual effects of COVID-19 infection in long COVID, yet evidence is limited.  Confirmed COVID-19 negative participants were 1:1 propensity-score matched to  COVID-19 positive participants. Symptoms occurring at least one-month following  COVID-infection and lasting more than three-months was defined as long COVID.  Measures of endothelial function included reactive hyperemic index  (RHI ≥ 1.67 = normal endothelial function) and augmentation index (higher  AIx = worse arterial elasticity). A total of 89 COVID-19 negative participants  was matched to 89 COVID-19 positive participants. Among the COVID-19 survivors,  the median age was 42.92 years, 46.07% were female sex, and 57 (64%) had long  COVID. Higher levels of inflammation (TNF-RI and oxLDL) and gut integrity  (zonulin and BDG) was associated (P < 0.05) with a two-fold increase in the odds  of long COVID. Female sex, independent of COVID-19 status, was 4x more likely to  have worse AIx (P < 0.0001) compared to male sex. Among female sex with long  COVID, higher levels of inflammation (IL-6, VCAM, hsCRP) and gut integrity  (zonulin) was independently associated (P < 0.05) with higher AIx. Female sex  with long COVID symptoms had the worse inflammation, gut integrity, and arterial  stiffness among COVID-19 survivors. This reinforces the importance of continued,  long-term follow-up care following COVID-19 infection, with special attention  needed for female sex who may be at a higher cardiovascular disease risk.  © 2025.

Recent investigations have demonstrated a relationship between the persistence  of SARS-CoV-2 and post-COVID-19 conditions. Building upon a potential connection  between SARS-CoV-2 persistence and early virologic rebound, we examine the  association of early virologic rebound with post-acute mortality and  hospitalization due to post-acute sequelae among hospitalized patients with  COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Our study includes 13,859, 3959, and 4502 patients in the  all-patient, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and molnupiravir group, respectively.  Results show that patients who experienced virologic rebound exhibited a  significantly higher risk of post-acute mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.70) with a risk difference [RD] of 7.19%,  compared with patients without virologic rebound. A similar increase in the risk  of post-acute mortality is also observed in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated  patients (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.41-2.25; RD, 12.55%) and molnupiravir-treated  patients (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18-1.82; RD, 4.90%). The virologic rebound may  thus serve as an early marker for post-COVID-19 condition, enabling healthcare  officials to monitor and provide timely intervention for long COVID.  © 2025.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant health challenges, including  increased risk of mortality and long-term complications. While vaccination has  proven remarkably effective in mitigating severe disease and mortality  associated with acute COVID-19 infection, the long-term implications of  vaccination, particularly its influence on post-COVID cardiovascular events and  the temporal dynamics of such effects, remain poorly understood. This target  trial emulation study utilizes real-world electronic medical record data from  April 2021 to March 2023 to address this gap. We evaluate the effect of  pre-infection COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of major acute cardiovascular  events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in individuals aged 40-85 years during one  year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among individuals with COVID-19 (n = 18,223  vaccinated, n = 15,331 not vaccinated), vaccination provided a significant  protective effect against MACE (weighted incidence rate ratio [wIRR] 0.71, 95%  CI 0.58-0.84) and all-cause mortality (wIRR 0.32, 95% CI 0.28-0.36). This effect  persisted for approximately three months after the acute infection. These  findings underscore the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing both  short-term and long-term health risks associated with the infection.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Pre-COVID health-related quality of life predicts symptoms and outcomes for  patients with long COVID.

BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a prevalent condition with  variable symptom presentation. PASC occurs more often with pre-existing medical  conditions, however it is unknown whether pre-COVID health-related quality of  life (HRQL) is associated with PASC. Similarly, the trajectory of HRQL following  PASC is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our study sought to evaluate (1) whether pre-COVID HRQL is associated  with PASC symptoms; (2) whether PASC patients have worse pre-COVID HRQL compared  to matched controls; and (3) to compare HRQL trajectories from pre-COVID to  1-year follow-up between PASC patients and matched controls. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with propensity-score matched control group. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort included 1,114 adult patients (mean age 53 ± 14, 75%  female) seen in a PASC clinic between 2/10/21 and 3/27/24 who completed HRQL  surveys prior to their initial COVID-diagnosis in a large health system. A  propensity-score matched control group included patients with COVID-19 without  PASC. MAIN MEASURES: HRQL was measured with PROMIS Global Health [global mental health  (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) summary scores]. KEY RESULTS: PASC symptoms were significantly associated with pre-COVID HRQL.  Symptoms most associated with PROMIS-GMH included diarrhea/nausea [odds ratio  (OR) = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.16-1.39) per five-point worsening] and brain fog [OR =  1.25 (95% CI: 1.14-1.37)], while fatigue [OR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.15-1.68)] had the  highest association with PROMIS-GPH. Pre-COVID GMH and GPH were significantly  worse for PASC patients compared to controls [-2.6 (SE 0.4) and -3.4 (0.3)  T-score points, respectively]. At 1-year following COVID, PASC patients worsened  significantly in GMH and GPH (-2.0 ± 8.2 and -1.2 ± 7.5 T-score points,  respectively), compared to controls who worsened significantly on GMH but not  GPH (-0.8 ± 7.7 and 0.2 ± 7.4 T-score points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PASC, worse pre-COVID HRQL was associated with  more PASC-related symptoms. PASC patients had worse pre-COVID HRQL compared to  matched controls and experienced a greater decline in HRQL 1-year after  COVID-diagnosis; however, this decline was below the threshold for clinical  significance.

Five years later, progress in disease  characterization has been considerable, and definitions continue to evolve.  Several disease mechanisms are under study, and evidence for multiple endotypes  is accumulating. No clinical biomarker has been identified, nor has an effective  therapy been developed. Overlap with other post-infectious syndromes,  particularly myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, is now more  evident. For most individuals, symptoms of long Covid progressively disappear  over time. Recurrent Covid-19 infections are now an important contributor to the  pool of affected individuals. While symptoms limit activity in as many as 20%,  inability to work is less common. The anticipated surge of disability claims  from insured individuals has not materialized.

Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed ""long COVID"" or  post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19  disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of  acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of  new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of  the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which  pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We  utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the  SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus  macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to  SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG  induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not  appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including  neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin  sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity  levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore,  several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection  to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple  parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more  prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with many  COVID-19 patients subsequently developing chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic  encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Long-term associations between COVID-19, new-onset  CFS/ME, and other independent predictors such as vaccination for SARS-CoV-2,  re-infection, and blood biomarkers at time of infection remain unclear. This  study investigated the incidence and independent predictors of developing  new-onset CFS/ME up to 4 years post SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to  COVID- controls. METHODS: This retrospective analysis conducted within the Montefiore Health  System from February 1, 2020, to January 12, 2024 included adults without a  prior diagnosis of fatigue or CFS/ME who were hospitalized for COVID-19  (n = 10,667), not hospitalized for COVID-19 (n = 25,409), and non-COVID-19  controls (n = 111,301). The observation time was between 30 days and 4 years  post index date. The outcome was new-onset CFS/ME. Multivariate adjusted hazard  ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, assessing risk posed  by SARS-CoV-2 infection, re-infection, and vaccination. Whether abnormal levels  of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase,  ferritin, hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and temperature  during hospitalization were associated with future CFS/ME risk was examined. RESULTS: Compared to COVID- controls, the risk of developing new-onset CFS/ME  was higher among both COVID-19 hospitalized (adjusted HR = 1.46 [1.07, 1.99])  and non-hospitalized patients (1.56 [1.25, 1.93]). Females (1.54 [1.27, 1.89]),  patients with liver disease (1.61 [1.29, 2.00]), autoimmune disorders (1.57  [1.18, 2.08]), and anxiety disorders (1.35 [1.04, 1.74]) were more likely to  develop CFS/ME (p < 0.05). Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with  increased risk of incident CFS/ME. COVID-19 vaccination status during the  initial phase of the rollout (prior to 2022) was associated with an increased  risk of new-onset CFS/ME (p < 0.05). None of the blood biomarkers during acute  COVID-19 were associated with new-onset CFS/ME risk (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of  new-onset CFS/ME, independent of hospitalization status. Females, and  individuals with autoimmune and anxiety disorders were more susceptible. These  findings highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and management of  fatigue-related symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity  and lost workdays in both military and non-military populations. To better  understand these infections and their outcomes, the Infectious Diseases Clinical  Research Program has enabled nine major ARI clinical research protocols in the  last decade, including observational studies and trials, spanning emerging and  reemerging ARI threats including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  2, influenza, adenovirus, entero/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory  syncytial virus, and other pathogens. These protocols have resulted in  epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and biospecimens from over 26,000  participants, most of whom were beneficiaries of a geographically distributed  Military Health System. METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Repository Protocol establishes a  unique Department of Defense (DoD) research resource through the pooling of data  and specimens from nine ARI protocols into a master, standardized database with  a linked specimen repository. This will enable further targeted scientific  questions in participant-level pooled meta-analyses and will serve as an  on-demand repository for rapid assay development, sample size estimations for  prospective studies, and observational study/clinical trial design (including as  part of future rapid pandemic research response). Accordingly, the objectives  and study design of this protocol are broad. This protocol will allow analyses  on outcomes including: (i) short-term ARI outcomes such as hospitalization, work  days lost, symptom severity and duration; (ii) post-acute ARI outcomes,  including persistence of symptoms, return-to-health, post-ARI medical  encounters; (iii) vaccine effectiveness for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  influenza, and adenovirus vaccines; (iv) ARI infection and vaccination elicited  immune responses (humoral, T-cell, other); (v) therapeutic effectiveness of  COVID-19 and influenza antivirals (acute symptoms, hospitalization, post-acute  sequelae); (vi) effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,  masking) against infection; (vii) prognostic and mechanistic host viral  biomarkers which correlate with the above outcomes; (viii) ARI diagnostic assay  validity and performance. This repository protocol is inherently broad in scope;  the collation of standardized data and phenotype-linked specimens is a  fundamental, primary objective. DISCUSSION: This protocol will support statistical and laboratory analyses,  including activities related to rapid epidemic response such as assay  development and rapid sample size calculations for clinical trials. A series of  more specific scientific questions from current and future collaborators will  leverage this joint database and specimen repository; these questions will  target important aspects of ARI infection, transmission, outcomes, and  treatment. Future protocols (and ongoing data from existing IDCRP protocols)  will be added to this collaborative repository protocol.

Many difficult-to-understand clinical features characterize COVID-19 and  post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or long COVID [LC]). These can include  blood pressure instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and  neuropsychiatric complaints. The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear.  The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds angiotensin  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells to initiate infection.  We hypothesized that some people convalescing from COVID-19 may produce anti-RBD  antibodies that resemble ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity,  that is, they are ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the  pathogenesis of COVID-19 and LC. In previous work, we showed that some people  with acute COVID-19 had immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic  activity, suggesting that some people with COVID-19 indeed produced ACE2-like  abzymes. However, it remained unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only  in acute COVID-19 or whether ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in  people convalescing from COVID-19. Here, we show that some people convalescing  from COVID-19 attending a clinic for people with persistent pulmonary symptoms  also have ACE2-like abzymes and that the presence of ACE2-like catalytic  activity correlates with alterations in blood pressure in an exercise test. IMPORTANCE: Patients who have had COVID-19 can sometimes have troublesome  symptoms, termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID (LC),  which can include problems with blood pressure regulation, gastrointestinal  problems, inflammation, blood clotting, and symptoms like ""brain fog."" The  proximate causes for these problems are not known, which makes these problems  difficult to treat definitively. We previously found that some acute COVID-19  patients make antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,  that act like an enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 normally  helps regulate blood pressure and serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the  body. We show that patients convalescing from COVID-19 also make antibodies that  act like ACE2 and that the presence of those antibodies correlates with problems  in blood pressure regulation. The findings provide a new opening to potentially  understanding the causes of LC, and so provide direction for the development of  new treatments.  DOI: 10.1128/mbio.01735-25 PMID: 40693778"

INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiology of respiratory complications in post-acute  sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection (PASC) is poorly understood, but a high incidence of progressive  pulmonary fibrosis was anticipated. Deupirfenidone (LYT-100) is a selectively  deuterated form of pirfenidone that retains antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory  activity but with improved tolerability. This study evaluated the safety and  efficacy of deupirfenidone in PASC patients with respiratory complications. METHODS: Global, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial evaluating  750 mg deupirfenidone twice daily versus placebo for 3 months in PASC patients  with respiratory complications following hospitalisation for acute COVID-19  infection severe enough to necessitate supplemental oxygen (NCT04652518). RESULTS: 185 patients were randomised and treated (95 with deupirfenidone, 90  with placebo), with 177 included in the modified intention-to-treat population.  The mean age was 54.5 years, 62.7% were male and 10.7% had prior mechanical  ventilation. The 6-min walk distance improved across both arms between baseline  and day 91 (deupirfenidone 44.3 m (95% CI 24.8-63.8 m) versus placebo 48.8 m  (95% CI 29.2-68.4 m); p=0.70). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) for deupirfenidone versus placebo were nausea (9.5% versus 1.1%), upper  abdominal discomfort (5.3% versus 2.2%) and dyspepsia (6.3% versus 1.1%). TEAEs  leading to trial drug discontinuation were 11.6% for deupirfenidone and 4.4% for  placebo. The proportion of discontinuations considered at least possibly related  to treatment was 8.6% for deupirfenidone and 2.4% for placebo. DISCUSSION: Most patients with PASC and respiratory complications showed  significant improvement over 91 days irrespective of treatment assignment.  Deupirfenidone was well tolerated, with low rates of TEAEs, which supports  further investigation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Copyright ©The authors 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) presents in a multitude of ways, with  fatigue, physical constraints, and diminished quality of life being common  symptoms. It is becoming increasingly clear that unimodal behavioral  interventions do benefit all PCS patients. Adherence to and response to isolated  psychotherapy or physical activity interventions vary greatly, with certain  patients benefit more from one form of therapy, or even a combination, than  others do. The study aims to compare the effects of a single exercise therapy,  psychotherapy, and a combination of both therapies. METHODS: The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized controlled,  open-label trial with 3 treatment arms (exercise therapy, psychotherapy, and  combined therapy). According to the sample size calculation, 65 participants  will be enrolled in each group. The primary outcome is the change of PCS fatigue  symptoms from baseline to 3 months, estimated by the Fatigue Assessment Scale.  Secondary endpoints include changes in further measures of fatigue (Chalder  Fatigue Skala, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Post-exertional Malaise  Scale, Bell Scale), health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 and Brief  Illness Perception Questionnaire), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale), and work ability (Work Ability Index). The intervention lasts  for 3 months and includes online therapy sessions of 50 min every 2 weeks or in  case of lack of concentration or fatigue this could be split to two 25-min  sessions (all equating to a total of 300 min of specialist care). The  psychotherapy adopts a short-term and coping-oriented approach based on the  unique requirements of each patient from a psychotherapeutic perspective.  Exercise therapy involves a personalized physical activity plan customized to  suit the patient's requirements, with tracking day-to-day physical activity  along with daily moderate endurance and strengthening workouts. An ANCOVA model,  including the stratification factors sex and BMI, will be used for the primary  analysis of Fatigue Assessment Scale. Significance tests will be based on the  group differences in least square means and corresponding 95% CIs. DISCUSSION: Due to the current relevance of the issue, the unclear evidence so  far, and the lack of appropriately powered randomized studies, it is crucial to  assess potentially effective concepts for treating patients with PCS. Future  therapy decisions will benefit from answering the question of whether combined  therapies hold a significant advantage over unimodal therapeutic approaches, as  well as identifying predictors that indicate an advantage of certain therapies  for particular patients.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 condition presents complex symptomatology involving  multifaceted interactions, which has resulted in a current lack of comprehensive  understanding of its disease trajectory. This knowledge gap significantly  compromises the efficiency of symptom management and adversely affects patients'  quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to comprehensively characterize the temporal  evolution of post-COVID-19 condition by identifying core symptom clusters and  clinical phenotypes, thereby enhancing understanding of the disease trajectory. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched from  December 1, 2019, to March 1, 2024. Observational studies related to the  prevalence of symptoms in post-COVID-19 condition had been included. We  conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize symptom prevalence across different  follow-up intervals following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and used a network to explore  interrelationships and co-occurrence patterns among symptoms, enabling the  identification of core symptoms and changes over time. Clustering analysis was  used to classify included studies into distinct clinical subtypes. RESULTS: This study analyzed 155 sets of macrolevel data from 108 clinical  studies, encompassing 63,771 patients. Fatigue was the most prevalent symptom  across all 4 follow-up points (52%, 48%, 46%, and 54%). Dyspnea peaked at the  third and sixth follow-ups (36% and 31%) and then declined steadily (28% and  22%). Subgroup analysis revealed that Africa reported the fewest symptoms  overall, yet showed high early incidences of fatigue (68%, 95% CI 50%-85%) and  dyspnea (56%, 95% CI 15%-98%). The Americas placed greater emphasis on symptom  evolution within the first postinfection year, with notably higher prevalence of  anxiety (60%, 95% CI 54%-66%) and depression (36%, 95% CI 16%-55%). Asia and  Europe documented the most comprehensive symptom profiles, with Asia reporting  lower early dyspnea rates (29%, 95% CI 18%-40%) and Europe exhibiting more  complex multisystem involvement during long-term follow-up. Network analysis  showed that core post-COVID-19 symptoms evolved from early  respiratory-neurological manifestations to chronic multisystem symptoms  dominated by dizziness. Clustering analysis further indicated a progressive  convergence of 2 initially distinct post-COVID-19 subtypes, with the acute  inflammatory type becoming less prominent and gradually transitioning into a  more chronic, persistent pattern. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic  evolution of post-COVID-19 condition symptoms and clinical subtypes,  highlighting their multisystem involvement. The results reveal a progressive  decline in respiratory symptoms over time, while neurological manifestations  emerge as the most persistent and systemically impactful core symptoms. Our  findings emphasize the need for region-specific surveillance and early warning  systems informed by symptom progression patterns. By continuously monitoring the  trajectories of symptom clusters, this approach offers valuable insights for  identifying early warning signals and targeted intervention points in the  management of postinfectious sequelae arising from future large-scale epidemics.  © Mingzhi Hu, Tian Song, Zhaoyuan Gong, Qianzi Che, Jing Guo, Lin Chen, Haili  Zhang, Huizhen Li, Ning Liang, Guozhen Zhao, Yanping Wang, Nannan Shi, Bin Liu.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms such as  fatigue, dyspnea, cough, insomnia, and exercise intolerance, poses a significant  challenge to global healthcare systems. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has  been used to manage post-viral syndromes, but high-quality evidence for its  effectiveness in post-COVID-19 recovery is limited. This study aimed to evaluate  the clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating  post-COVID-19 syndrome through a systematic review and meta-analysis of  randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane  Library and CNKI) were systematically searched up to March 15, 2025. RCTs  comparing CHM with placebo or usual care in patients with confirmed  post-COVID-19 syndrome were included. Primary outcomes were symptom severity  measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); secondary outcomes included relief  rates of cough, fatigue, chest tightness, dyspnea, insomnia, and exercise  intolerance. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity  was assessed using I2 statistics. RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 2401 patients were included. CHM showed a greater  reduction in VAS scores compared to controls (MD = -1.03; 95% CI -2.10 to 0.03;  P = 0.0577), with higher heterogeneity (I2 = 92%). Although this result did not  reach conventional statistical significance, it suggests a potentially  meaningful clinical trend favoring CHM. Subgroup analysis indicated both  short-term and long-term CHM treatments improved VAS scores, with a stronger  effect in long-term treatment. CHM significantly improved chest tightness  (RR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.21-1.61; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0%) and insomnia (RR = 1.23; 95%  CI 1.03-1.47; P = 0.0216; I2 = 0%). A trend toward improvement was observed in  fatigue (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 0.95-2.64; P = 0.0781) and dyspnea (RR = 1.39, 95% CI  0.99-1.95; P = 0.0554), although these results did not reach statistical  significance. No significant difference was observed in terms of 6-min walking  distance (MD = 13.95 m, 95% CI -11.64 to 39.55; P = 0.2853). Adverse event rates  were comparable between the herbal and control groups (RR = 0.72, 95% CI  0.49-1.07; P = 0.1052). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that Traditional Chinese Medicine  (TCM) may help relieve certain post-COVID-19 symptoms, especially chest  tightness and insomnia. Trends toward benefit were also noted for fatigue and  dyspnea, though without statistical significance. Given the non-significant VAS  results and high heterogeneity, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.  Further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to validate these outcomes  and optimize treatment strategies.

Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a substantial burden for patients, society, and  the healthcare system. Participants of the German National Cohort (NAKO) were  asked in an online survey about their self-perceived health, symptoms related to  PCC, and infection status. PCC was defined as reporting symptoms for the time  window 4-12 months after infection. Of 110,375 respondents (73% response),  86,833 were included in this analysis. Of these, 44,451 (51%) did not report a  SARS-CoV-2 infection (no infection), 26,726 (31%) reported an infection but no  symptoms 4-12 months after infection (infection/no PCC), and 15,656 (18%)  reported an infection and symptoms (PCC). The median number of current symptoms  at the time of the survey was two for the ""no infection"" and the ""infection/no  PCC"" group, and five for the ""PCC"" group. Participants with PCC had a  substantially higher probability of having worse self-perceived health (OR 1.84,  95% CI [1.75; 1.93] compared to the ""no infection"" group, adjusting for sex,  age, education and chronic diseases with elevated risk for developing PCC. After  adjusting for the number of current symptoms related to PCC, this difference  disappeared, suggesting that the symptoms collected explain the impairment of  self-perceived health in the PCC group.  © 2025.

Neuropsychiatric long covid  symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well  as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been  hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present,  objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some  evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for  older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a  delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months  after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery  period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient  trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.

Post-COVID-19 condition, or Long COVID, is characterised by symptoms persisting  or emerging beyond 12 weeks after acute infection. Among over 200 reported  symptoms, oral manifestations such as taste loss and dry mouth have been  identified. This systematic review reports the frequency and characteristics of  these symptoms. Registered in PROSPERO and following PRISMA guidelines, the  review included observational studies on COVID-19-positive adults presenting  oral symptoms in the post-COVID-19 condition. A search in six databases  (Medline/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and LILACS) was  conducted in January 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs  Institute's critical appraisal tools, and certainty of evidence via GRADE. A  meta-analysis using the inverse variance method estimated oral symptom  prevalence. Of 4552 articles, 107 were included. Taste dysfunction persisted in  8% (95% CI 6%-10%) of patients beyond 12 weeks. Combined taste and smell  alterations had a prevalence of 17% (95% CI 13%-21%). Less frequent symptoms  included hyposalivation, periodontitis, mouth ulcers, tongue mucosal changes,  facial tingling, sensitivity in the trigeminal nerve, difficulty swallowing, and  lesions in the hard palate. Taste alterations were the most commonly reported  symptom, underscoring the need for clinical recognition and appropriate  management by oral health professionals. Additionally, the wide range of other  oral manifestations highlights the necessity for further research to better  understand their prevalence, underlying mechanisms, and clinical implications in  post-COVID-19 patients.  © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Long COVID (LC), also known as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome  (PASC), has emerged as a significant public health concern characterized by  persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This condition affects  regardless of initial illness severity and can significantly impair daily  functioning. Understanding the implications of LC is crucial, given that  approximately 6.9 % of adults reported related symptoms in 2022, with increased  prevalence among women and individuals of Hispanic descent. The pathogenesis of  LC is multifactorial, involving mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction,  chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and potential viral persistence. The  clinical manifestations include fatigue, cognitive impairment, musculoskeletal  pain, and sleep disturbances. Current research emphasizes the importance of  early antiviral interventions and vaccines to mitigate the risk of developing  LC. Despite promising therapies like anti-inflammatory agents and metabolic  enhancers, the lack of established biomarkers complicates diagnosis and  treatment. AREAS COVERED: The authors provide an overview of the pathogenesis of LC and  briefly review the currently available therapy. The authors then give their  perspectives on how best future drug discovery efforts can be utilized to  address the current demand for novel LC therapeutics to reduce the burden of  this public health problem. EXPERT OPINION: Progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology and  potential treatment options, as well as in establishing reliable biomarkers for  potential tailored strategies. Future research should prioritize both  pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to enhance patient  outcomes and quality of life. Addressing these challenges is essential for  developing comprehensive care protocols for individuals affected by LC.  DOI: 10.1080/17460441.2025.2534056 PMID: 40660830"

INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) may include pulmonary sequelae,  fatigue and other symptoms, but its mechanisms are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the correlation between fatigue and the  presence of pulmonary abnormalities in PCC patients with respiratory involvement  6-12 months after hospitalisation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 315 patients, aged ≥18 years, were considered eligible based on  SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. METHODS: Pulmonary function tests (PFT), cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET),  chest CT and hand grip were performed. The following scales were applied:  Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale,  Euroqol 5 Dimensions quality of life (EQ-5D) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression  Scale (HADS). Participants were divided between the fatigue group (FACIT-F≤30)  and the non-fatigue group (FACIT-F>30). For the statistical analysis, the  primary outcome was the difference in the diffusing capacity of the lungs for  carbon monoxide (DLCO) between groups. Considered secondary outcomes were  differences in PFT, CPET, chest CT, hand grip, EQ-5D and HADS. RESULTS: The fatigue group had 81 patients (25.7%) against 234 (74.3%). PFT and  CPET showed no significant difference in DLCO and oxygen consumption peak values  between groups. The fatigue group had a lower workload (mean 55.3±21.3 watts vs  66.5±23.2 watts, p=0.003), higher breathing reserve (median 41.9% (33.8-52.5) vs  37.7% (28.9-47.1), p=0.028) and lower prevalence of ground glass opacity (60.8%  vs 77.7%, p=0.003) and reticulation (36.7% vs 54.9%, p=0.005) in chest CT. The  fatigue group had higher anxiety (57% vs 24%, p<0.001), depression (50.6% vs  13.6%, p<0.001), lower health-related quality of life (median 50 (32-63) vs 80  (61.3-88.3), p<0.001) and lower hand grip strength (median 15.8 (6-21) kgf vs 21  (12.1-30) kgf, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Fatigue in patients with PCC 6-12 months after hospitalisation is  relatively common and had weak correlation with pulmonary disorders. Our results  suggested fatigue could be strongly related with peripheral disorders such as  reduced musculoskeletal strength or psychosocial limitations.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving since 2019, affecting over  536 million individuals and causing more than six million deaths. After the  acute phase, the onset or persistence of symptoms grouped under the name of long  COVID is reported. The variability of symptomatology makes this a relevant  subject of study, since more than one million cases of COVID-19 have been  reported in Tunisia. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence and  potential risk factors for long COVID. METHODS: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the  COVID unit of the emergency department of Abderrahmane Mami Hospital in Tunisia  from April 1st to August 1st, 2021. The National Institute of Health Care  definition of long COVID (November 2021) was adopted. RESULTS: overall, 1,271 patients were admitted during the study period. After  excluding deceased and unreachable patients by telephone, 454 were included in  the analysis. The mean age was 58.6 ± 13.9 years, with a male predominance  (53.7%). The prevalence of long COVID was 84.8%. The most common manifestations  were breathing discomfort, asthenia, memory problems, tiredness, and arthralgia.  In multivariable analysis, female sex was identified as a risk factor for long  COVID (aOR: 1.732, 95% CI 1.002-2.995; p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: the high prevalence of long COVID observed in our study highlights  the need for post-COVID follow-up among affected patients. Our findings suggest  that women had a higher risk of developing long COVID, indicating the benefit of  individualized monitoring and care programs for this group.  Copyright: Nawel Dhaouadi et al.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of post-COVID-condition (PCC, also known as  long-COVID) and investigated its associations with health-related quality of  life and immune-related biomarkers in track and field masters athletes (MAs). A  total of 216 MAs (114 males, 102 females; age: 58.3 ± 11.9 vs.  56.6 ± 11.7 years; BMI: 23.6 [22.2-24.8] vs. 21.3 [20.0-23.6] kg/m2) reported  their post-COVID-conditions via the Post-COVID Syndrome Questionnaire (PCSQ). In  a subgroup of 108 MAs, fasting blood samples were collected to assess C-reactive  protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker of immune status (MAs-CRP). Based on their  PCSQ sum score, MAs were divided into three groups: no/mild, moderate, and  severe. Associations between PCC severity and sex, athletic specialty, and  competition level were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Forty-six (21%) MAs  were identified with clinically relevant moderate-to-severe post-COVID-19  conditions (PCSQ score > 10.75). The most frequently reported symptoms included  musculoskeletal pain (15%), sleep disturbance (13%), sensory or respiratory  symptoms (11%), fatigue (11%), and flu-like symptoms (11%). PCC prevalence did  not differ by sex, athletic specialties, training load, or prior competition  level (all p > 0.05). MAs with moderate-to-severe PCC had significantly lower  physical and mental component scores of quality of life compared with those with  no or mild symptoms (p < 0.05). In the MAs-CRP subgroup, self-reported cardiac  ailments and flu-like symptoms were significantly and positively associated with  CRP levels (Spearman ρ = 0.27-0.30, all p < 0.01). Post-COVID-19 condition is  associated with reduced quality of life in track and field masters athletes,  independent of sex, prior competition levels, and training characteristics.  Furthermore, low-grade inflammation based on CRP levels was associated with  self-reported cardiac and flu-like symptoms.  © 2025 The Author(s).

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system.  Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent,  disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation,  autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of  SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological  symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood  disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine  imbalance, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell  exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis  factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament  light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative  review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological  sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction,  and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping  neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,  including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how  SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the  development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long  COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include  immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and  strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in  neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies  guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential.  Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold  promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued  interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus-immune-brain  axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.

Background/Objectives: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals  infected with SARS-CoV-2 have progressively displayed a range of symptoms linked  to protracted COVID during the post-acute phase of illness. Concurrently, in  several nations globally, the phenomenon of population aging has been  intensifying. In this scenario, the aged population has become both vulnerable  and high-risk during the acute phase of COVID-19, and faces significant dangers  associated with long-COVID. This study seeks to analyze the incidence and  spatial distribution of health complications in older people affected by  COVID-19, in the first year of the pandemic (2020), in the State of Paraná, as  well as to identify the factors associated with the development of  cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and metabolic diseases. Method: An  observational and retrospective study was carried out in the Brazilian state of  Paraná. Participants were randomly selected from two databases. A total of 893  older people (≥60 years) participated in the study 12 months after acute  COVID-19 infection. Telephone questionnaires were applied between March and  December 2021. The Moran index test, logistic regression, and Poisson models  were used to analyze the data. Results: In terms of age, most participants (66%)  were between 60 and 69 years old, 25.8% were between 70 and 79 years old, and  8.2% were 80 years old or older. Most participants were female (51.2%), white  (98.1%), had a partner (69.8%), and had been hospitalized due to COVID-19  (59.3%). Cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent in the population  (39.5%), followed by metabolic diseases (27.3%). The long-term use of medication  was associated with the development of metabolic diseases (aOR = 9.8),  cardiovascular diseases (aOR = 6.6), and diseases in multiple organic systems  (aOR = 3.2); living alone was associated with neurological diseases (aOR = 2.5),  and the age group of 80 years or older (aOR = 2.4) was associated with  cardiovascular events. The spatial distribution showed that complications in  body groups are distributed randomly among the health regions of the state, with  no influence from neighboring locations. Conclusions: Post-COVID-19 health  complications are more frequent in older adults who have comorbidities and  long-term medication use. Therefore, long-term monitoring of these individuals  and investment in public policies for rehabilitation and prevention of  complications are necessary.

While many individuals recovered from COVID-19, some developed  long-lasting symptoms that significantly disrupted daily life. The WHO defines  this condition as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Common symptoms include  fatigue, dyspnoea, sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Increasing  evidence suggests that PCC is a multifactorial condition, shaped not only by  biomedical but also psychological and social factors. This article presents the  protocol of the Basel Long COVID Cohort Study (BALCoS), which aims to improve  understanding of PCC by capturing clinical, functional and psychosocial aspects  through repeated assessments over the course of 1 year. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: BALCoS is a prospective, single-site cohort study.  Inclusion criteria include either a probable or confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2  infection with persistent symptoms consistent with the WHO definition of PCC,  sufficient German language skills and age ≥18 years. At baseline, we collected  detailed information on previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptom history,  reinfections, COVID-19 vaccination status and pre-existing medical conditions.  The study includes standardised psychometric assessments, physical performance  tests, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), neurocognitive testing and blood  sample collection. Assessments are scheduled at baseline and at 3-month, 6-month  and 12-month follow-up. All participants complete psychometric assessments at  each time point. Blood samples are only collected at baseline. Neurocognitive  testing and physical performance measures are collected at baseline and 12-month  follow-up for in-person participants only. Participants who are unable to attend  in person complete a remote version of the study, excluding these in-clinic  assessments. EMAs are initiated the day after each time point and consist of  eight questions over 10 consecutive days. The study is exploratory in nature,  with a target sample size of 120 participants. BALCoS is part of the Horizon  Europe Long COVID project, a multinational interdisciplinary research consortium  integrating mechanistic, clinical and interventional studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of  Northwest and Central Switzerland (BASEC-ID: 2023-00359) and is registered at  ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05781893). All participants provide written informed  consent. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic affecting  millions worldwide. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap between acute  and chronic symptoms, vaccination impact, and associated factors in patients  across different low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 2,445 participants aged 18 years and  older, testing positive for COVID-19. Data collection involved screening for  medical histories, testing records, symptomatology, and persistent symptoms.  Validated instruments, including the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ-2) and  the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), were used. We applied a  self-supervised and unsupervised deep neural network to extract features from  the questionnaire. Gradient boosted machines (GBM) model was used to build a  risk calculator for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), depression, and prolonged  COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the study cohort, 68.1% of the patients had symptoms lasting  longer than 2 weeks. The most frequent symptoms were loss of smell (46.8%), dry  cough (40.1%), loss of taste (37.8%), headaches (37.2%), and sore throat  (28.9%). The patients also reported high rates of depression (47.7%), chronic  fatigue (6.5%), and infection after vaccination (23.7%). Factors associated with  CFS included sex, age, and smoking. Vaccinated individuals demonstrated lower  odds of experiencing prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, CFS, and depression. The  predictive models achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.87,  0.82, and 0.74, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings underscore the significant burden of long-term symptoms  such as chronic fatigue and depression, affecting a considerable proportion of  individuals post-infection. Moreover, the study reveals promising insights into  the potential benefits of vaccination in mitigating the risk of prolonged  COVID-19 symptoms, CFS, and depression. Overall, this research contributes  valuable knowledge towards comprehensive management and prevention efforts  amidst the ongoing global pandemic.

Amplification of select autonomous HERV loci and surrounding host gene  transcription in monocytes from patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.  Koo H(1), Morrow CD(2).

BACKGROUND: The human genome contains approximately 3,200 near full-length  autonomous human endogenous retroviral (HERV) genomes distributed across the 23  chromosomes. These autonomous HERV proviral genomes include long terminal  repeats (LTRs) capable of promoting RNA transcription. In quiescent cells, most  HERV loci remain transcriptionally silent. However, environmental changes, such  as epigenetic remodeling of chromatin, can activate these silenced loci. METHODS: To study HERV reactivation, we previously analyzed autonomous HERV  expression patterns in monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) identified in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases  using the Azimuth application. We developed a Window-based HERV Alignment (WHA)  method, which analyzes aligned DNA sequences using sequential, non-overlapping  windows of defined lengths. Samples were scored as positive (>= 9 good/usable  windows) or negative (<= 8 good/usable windows). RESULTS: Using WHA, we established a control set from 31 normal individuals,  with fewer than 8 windows at selected HERV loci. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from  three studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found distinct HERV  expression patterns in monocytes. Unique patterns were also found in patients  with influenza, Dengue virus, or sepsis. We next examined HERV expression at  early (<7 days) and late (>14 days) timepoints post COVID-19 recovery and  detected HERV loci in both groups. Analyzing 12 patients with post-acute  sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), we identified three HERV loci expressed in all  patients. Some loci showed amplified numbers of good/usable windows, indicating  longer transcripts and greater sequence depth. The most amplified locus was  located within an intron of JAKMIP2, which, along with neighboring host genes,  also showed increased transcription. CONCLUSION: Previous studies have shown that viral infections, including  COVID-19, influenza, and Dengue virus, as well as sepsis, can induce innate  immune memory in monocytes through epigenetic remodeling of hematopoietic stem  and myeloid precursor cells. The identification of co-amplified HERV loci and  neighboring host gene transcripts in monocytes from PASC patients suggests  expansion of epigenetically remodeled myeloid progenitors. The identification of  these HERV-host gene patterns provides a foundation needed to understand the  clinical features of patients with PASC.  Copyright © 2025 Koo and Morrow.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant  global morbidity, with long-term effects known as post-acute sequelae of  SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID syndrome. This study investigates the clinical  characteristics and long-term effects of COVID-19 in a rural South Indian  population. Conducted in a secondary healthcare setting in Kerala, India, the  study involved 65 subjects who had tested positive for COVID-19 more than 90  days prior. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on common COVID-19  and PASC symptoms and underwent pulmonary function testing. Data analysis  included descriptive statistics, point-biserial correlation, and logistic  regression. The prevalence of PASC symptoms was found to be 55.4%, with dyspnea  being the most common symptom. Healthcare workers experienced a lower prevalence  of PASC (41.9%) compared to non-healthcare workers (67.6%). Logistic regression  indicated higher odds of PASC in men, non-healthcare workers, and those with  comorbidities, though these findings were not statistically significant.  Pulmonary function tests revealed reduced forced vital capacity in 23.1% of  subjects. The study highlights the significant impact of long COVID on this  unvaccinated population prior to the Delta wave, emphasizing the need for  ongoing research to understand and manage the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Author information: (1)National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Diseases  and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, United States.  BACKGROUND: Long-COVID refers to ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms present 30  or more days after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection. This study examined the prevalence and severity of neurologic  symptoms at greater than 1 month following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and the  influence of pre-existing neurologic and psychiatric conditions, current  depression and anxiety status, and hospitalization on the presence and severity  of these symptoms. METHODS: This prospective cohort study recruited primarily self-referred  Long-COVID participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Online  questionnaires inquiring about pre-existing conditions, neurologic symptoms and  their severity pre, during and post COVID-19, and current anxiety and depression  screening were completed by 213 participants at a median time of 8 months after  infection. Descriptive analyses and prevalence modeling were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent neurologic symptoms post COVID-19 were fatigue,  concentration/memory difficulties, unrefreshed sleep, and dysarthria/word  finding difficulties (73.2-86.4%). Neurologic symptoms were highly prevalent  with significantly greater odds post COVID-19 compared to pre for all symptoms  and higher prevalence at time periods farther from infection, including those  implicit in fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.  Several severe neurologic symptoms were significantly more prevalent post  COVID-19. Moderate to severe anxiety (34%) and depression (27%) were observed  post COVID-19. Preexisting neurologic or psychiatric conditions did not  demonstrate any significant difference in neurologic symptom prevalence post  COVID-19. Those who met criteria for moderate or severe anxiety post COVID-19  had a significant difference in prevalence of fatigue, sensitivity to touch and  unrefreshed sleep. Similarly, fatigue, concentration/memory difficulty and  unrefreshed sleep were more prevalent in moderate to severe depression. There  were no significant differences in neurologic symptom prevalence in a  hospitalized group when compared to non- hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Long-COVID has a high burden of long lasting and severe neurological  sequelae. These sequelae are independent of pre-existing self-reported  neurologic and psychiatric conditions, as well as previous hospitalization.  Current moderate to severe anxiety and depression status can impact fatigue,  cognition, and sleep post COVID-19. Focus on the biological impact of SARS-CoV-2  on the nervous system will be essential in ameliorating the tremendous symptom  burden left in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Author information: (1)Department of Infectious Diseases, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan  College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.  BACKGROUND/AIMS: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) are highly  heterogeneous; therefore, the pathophysiological mechanisms for PASC remain  unclear. In this study, we aimed to examine the immunologic aspects of various  PASC symptoms. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled adults aged ≥ 18 years who were diagnosed  with COVID-19 between August 2022 and September 2023. Blood samples were  collected from all participants, who were interviewed using a questionnaire for  PASC symptoms at least once between 1 and 6 months after the COVID-19 diagnosis.  For immunological evaluation, plasma concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit  1-specific IgG and 33 cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assays and multiplex-based immunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 156 pairs of blood samples and symptom reports from 79  participants were eligible for analysis. The most frequent symptom was fatigue,  followed by post exertional malaise, chronic cough, thirst, and brain fog.  Gastrointestinal symptoms, chest pain, post exertional malaise, smell/taste  change, fatigue, brain fog, abnormal movement, and palpitation were accompanied  by significant increases in IL-10, VEGF, and inflammatory cytokines like MIP-1α,  IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MIG, granzyme A, and CX3CL1 levels, while chronic cough,  dizziness, dyspnea, and hair loss were not accompanied by significant  differences in cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Symptoms classified into different categories based on the  dysfunctional organs may share a common pathophysiology regarding elevation of  certain cytokines. Although PASC symptoms are heterogeneous, our findings  suggest that T-cell recruitment, thrombosis, and increased vascular permeability  might contribute to various symptom clusters sharing common pathophysiological  mechanisms.

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) are a complex clinical condition that  requires a better understanding of its underlying biological mechanisms. In this  study, we assessed hundreds of virological, serological, immunological, and  tissue damage biomarkers in two cohorts of patients who had experienced either  mild (n = 270) or severe (n = 188) COVID-19, 6 to 9 months post-initial  infection, and in which 40% and 57.4% of patients, respectively, developed PASC.  Blood analysis showed that the main differences observed in humoral, viral, and  biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather  than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed  altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting  cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells  (TEMRA). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells responsive to  nucleocapsid/membrane proteins with a TEMRA phenotype were also observed. A  random forest model identified these features and initial symptom duration as  top variables discriminating PASC, achieving over 80% classification accuracy.  © 2025 The Author(s).

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (PASC) is a widely reported phenomenon  wherein symptoms of COVID-19 infection persist for four weeks or more beyond  acute infection. Risk factors at baseline (prior to infection) for the  development of PASC are not well understood. This study aimed to identify  baseline demographic, physical and mental health characteristics associated with  the development of PASC. We identified 351 participants who reported contracting  COVID-19 and 145 that experienced PASC symptoms. Baseline physical health,  mental health, and demographic data were collected for all participants. Risk  factors for the development of PASC were identified using multivariable logistic  regression. PASC was associated with lower income, Hispanic ethnicity, younger  age, and respiratory conditions (asthma or COPD). Worse self-reported mental  health status, a diagnosis of depression, and a higher patient health  questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) score were also associated with PASC. We then used  latent class analysis and identified two subtypes of PASC, one with fewer PASC  symptoms (n = 112) and another with many PASC symptoms (n = 33). Risk factors  for membership in each class were different, but a past diagnosis of depression  predicted membership in both classes compared to those without PASC. A diagnosis  of depression was more strongly associated with the ""many symptoms"" class  compared to the ""few symptoms"" class. We find that several mental health and  demographic risk factors are linked to PASC. More research is necessary to  understand both the two subtypes of PASC identified in our analysis, and the  underlying relationship between COVID-19 infection and PASC.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID are  persistent multisystem illnesses affecting many patients. With no known  effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported  outcomes of treatments may prove helpful in identifying management strategies  that can improve patient care and generate new avenues for research. Here, we  present the results of an ME/CFS and long COVID treatment survey with responses  from 3,925 patients. We assess the experiences of these patients with more than  150 treatments in conjunction with their demographics, symptoms, and  comorbidities. Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits are identified.  Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar  symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of  ME/CFS and 79.4% of long COVID reported postexertional malaise (PEM).  Furthermore, treatment responses between these two patient groups were  significantly correlated (R2 = 0.68). Patient subgroups, characterized by  distinct symptom profiles and comorbidities, exhibited increased responses to  specific treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic  modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study  underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and long  COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of  infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. While this study  does not provide recommendations for specific therapies, in the absence of  approved treatments, insights from patient-reported experiences provide urgently  needed real-world evidence for developing targeted patient care therapies and  future clinical trials.

Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is a growing  global health concern, affecting 10-35% of COVID-19 survivors. Characterized by  persistent multisystem symptoms lasting beyond 12 weeks, common manifestations  include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, depression, and  anxiety. The underlying pathophysiology remains unclear but is likely to involve  immune dysregulation, persistent inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, gut  dysbiosis, and viral persistence. This review examines the epidemiology, risk  factors, and clinical manifestations of long COVID, with a focus on its impact  on cardiopulmonary, neurological, and mental health. Therapeutic approaches  include pharmacological interventions such as anti-inflammatory agents,  antioxidants, neuroprotective drugs, and repurposed medications.  Non-pharmacological strategies, such as physical rehabilitation, cognitive  therapy, dietary modification, and emerging therapies like stem cell therapy, as  well as immunomodulatory approaches, offer promising avenues for recovery. We  also highlight ongoing clinical trials evaluating targeted therapies for  long-term COVID syndrome. Future research should focus on elucidating the  pathophysiological mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and optimizing  personalized treatment strategies for long-term COVID-19 management.  © 2025.

The Effectiveness of Structured Neurologic Music Therapy on Phonation and  Breathing Function Following COVID-19.  Oleson CV(1), Onusko SW(2), Djohan MS(2), Roach MJ(2), Mizes CS(2), Conklyn  DB(2).  Author information: (1)Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation/Spinal Cord Injury Medicine, MetroHealth  Rehabilitation Institute/Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, USA. (2)Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, MetroHealth Medical Center/Case Western  Reserve University, Cleveland, USA.  Objective To analyze the effectiveness of neurologic music therapy (NMT),  consisting of diaphragmatic breathing (DB), vocal intonation therapy (VIT), and  therapeutic singing (TS), on sustained phonation and oxygen use during recovery  from the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19 or post-acute sequelae of  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) (PASC). Methods The  study was designed as a retrospective cohort study. Sixty-nine adults admitted  to acute inpatient rehabilitation with recent COVID-19 or PASC received standard  physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapies. All were given a  graded exhalation device with vibratory stimulation to help strengthen the  muscles of expiration and clear secretions. Bronchodilators were administered as  needed. Supplemental oxygen was prescribed to maintain saturations >92%.  Thirty-three individuals also chose to receive NMT 1-3 times weekly for the  duration of their inpatient rehabilitation hospitalization. The main outcome  measures were changes in oxygen demand during rehabilitation and breath control,  defined as sustained phonation (expiration) from a single breath. Secondary  outcomes were discharge disposition and NMT participant experience. Results  Compared with the non-NMT group, NMT participants required significantly more  oxygen during activity at both admission (p=.010) and discharge (p=.007). Within  the NMT group, significant improvement in oxygen demand was observed from  admission to discharge, both at rest (.7833L reduction, p=.003) and during  activity (.8500L reduction, p=.003). The degree of improvement in the need for  oxygen also showed differences between the two groups. Compared with non-NMT  participants, those receiving NMT demonstrated a significantly greater reduction  in activity-based oxygen use during rehabilitation (p=.014, Cohen's d 2.06).  Despite a longer duration in acute care than the non-NMT group, the NMT  participants had an equivalent number of days in inpatient rehabilitation and a  higher rate of home discharge (p=.018). Positive correlations were found in  changes in phonation abilities, measured by the number of NMT sessions completed  (p=.021) and by minutes of NMT received (p=.009). The majority of participants  rated their experience with this program as positive. Discussion Proper DB with  VIT and TS can have a meaningful effect on sustained phonation, breathing  tolerance, and vocalization, resulting in participants reporting fewer pauses  for air while speaking. NMT was considered a positive experience that also  potentially contributed to the reduction in oxygen dependence after COVID-19.  Copyright © 2025, Oleson et al.

INTRODUCTION: Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC),  is a complex condition characterized by a wide range of persistent symptoms that  can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and mental health. This  study explores public perspectives on the mental health impact of Long COVID and  the use of dietary supplements for recovery, drawing on social media content. It  uniquely addresses how individuals with Long COVID discuss supplement use in the  absence of public health recommendations. METHODS: The study employs the LISTEN method (""Collaborative and Digital  Analysis of Big Qual Data in Time Sensitive Contexts""), an interdisciplinary  approach that combines human insight and digital analysis software. Social media  data related to Long COVID, mental health, and supplement use were collected  using the Pulsar Platform. Data were analyzed using the free-text discourse  analysis tool Infranodus and collaborative qualitative analysis methods. RESULTS: The findings reveal key themes, including the impact of Long COVID on  mental health, occupational health, and the use of food supplements. Analysis of  attitudes toward supplement use highlights the prevalence of negative emotions  and experiences among Long COVID patients. The study also identifies the need  for evidence-based recommendations and patient education regarding supplement  use. DISCUSSION: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex  nature of Long COVID and inform the development of comprehensive,  patient-centered care strategies addressing both physical and mental health  needs.

COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health  problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people  worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We  investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the  development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137  convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic  wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that  were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms.  Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were  associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary,  otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with  increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk  associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies  for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital  organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly  for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%).  Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective  role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular  symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent  LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.  © 2025.

INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, exacerbated by  the emergence of new variants such as Omicron, has posed significant challenges  to healthcare systems worldwide. This study aimed to explore the potential  effectiveness of long-term traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use on COVID-19  infection and post-infection symptoms in cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: An anonymous online questionnaire was used to interview cancer  patients who had used TCM (TCM group) and those who had never used TCM (non-TCM  group) from March 31 to April 30,2023. A self-reported questionnaire was  developed to investigate and analyze the patients' demography, underlying cancer  types, treatment (TCM or non-TCM), clinical symptoms, and post-acute COVID-19  related symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 996 cancer patients participated (607 TCM, 389 non-TCM). The  non-TCM group had a higher infection rate (84.1% vs. 75.8%, p = 0.002). The TCM  group reported significantly lower levels of post-COVID-19 symptoms at 3 months  post-infection. Specifically, 98.0% of the TCM group reported no fatigue (91.7%  in the non-TCM group, p < 0.001), and 98.7% reported no sleep difficulties  (88.7% in the non-TCM group, p < 0.001). The median infection duration was 7  days in both groups, median body temperature was 38.2 °C in TCM and 38.3 °C in  non-TCM group, and the fever duration was 2 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: There was a potential association between long-term TCM use and  improved COVID-19 outcomes among cancer patients. Further research is essential  to validate these findings and decipher the underlying mechanisms.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in widespread  morbidity and mortality, with a significant portion of the affected population  experiencing long-term health complications. This review explores the mechanisms  of mitochondrial dysfunction in both the acute and post-acute phases of  COVID-19, highlighting its impact on various organs and its potential role in  the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We discuss how SARS-CoV-2  directly affects mitochondrial function and the role of the virus-induced immune  response in exacerbating mitochondrial impairment. This review highlights the  critical role of mitochondria in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the importance of  addressing mitochondrial health to mitigate acute and chronic effects of the  disease.  © 2024.

Patients with cancer and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with injectable  azithromycin and anakinra frequently develop dysglycemia, necessitating  initiation of sulfonylurea therapy (gliquidone or glimepiride). We  retrospectively reviewed adults (≥30 years) with diabetes and cancer who were  hospitalised for COVID-19 at the Central Military Hospital Bucharest and the  Matei Bals National Institute between March 2020 and August 2022. All patients  completed a 14-day course of azithromycin + anakinra and survived to discharge.  Glycaemic control was achieved with fixed-dose gliquidone 30 mg or glimepiride  2, 3, or 6 mg, chosen according to each patient's inflammatory-cardiac profile.  Central insulin resistance may lead to the risk of cardiometabolic syndrome  through the increase of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and PAI-1), treated with  gliquidone, in 50 patients with cancer infected with COVID-19, who were  dependent on developing immunothrombosis. Peripheral insulin resistance leads to  the risk of cardiovascular events through the increase of inflammatory markers,  IL-6 and Il-1, treated with glimepiride, in 50 patients with cancer infected  with COVID-19.  © 2025 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Long COVID, Post COVID Syndrome or PASC (post-acute sequelae of  COVID-19), according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is defined as the  continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial  SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no  other explanation. The term Long COVID will be used throughout this review.  Little is known about individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions  experiencing Long COVID. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of  these individuals, focusing on: 1) the course of mental disorders, 2) care  needs, 3) utilization of healthcare services, and 4) psychosocial aspects, as  outlined by the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). METHODS: This review followed the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) methodology for  scoping reviews and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. We included  reports focusing on individuals with at least one pre-existing mental health  diagnosis and Long COVID. Full-text reports in English or German were included,  with no geographical limitations. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed,  Embase, and PsycINFO on November 1, 2023, for records published between January  2020 and October 2023. Six reviewers participated in the screening process in  pairs, independently conducting study selection and data extraction. Conflicts  were resolved by consensus. Citation tracking was performed, and data were  summarized narratively in tables. RESULTS: From 4256 initial hits and citation tracking, 8 reports were included.  The studies were heterogeneous, including chart reviews, case reports,  cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies. Evidence on the impact of Long COVID  on pre-existing mental health conditions was inconsistent. Most findings focused  on the course of mental health disorders, ranging from symptom worsening to new  symptoms of anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Evidence on mental health care  needs, service utilization, and psychosocial aspects was limited. CONCLUSION: Limited evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing mental  health disorders who experience Long COVID may be at an increased risk of  worsening mental health. However, critical aspects such as care needs, service  utilization, and psychosocial factors remain under-researched, highlighting the  need for further studies on mental health care for Long COVID.

The global COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to pose a  significant threat to public health and the economy. SARS-CoV-2 is highly  contagious, transmitted primarily through direct contact or inhalation of  droplets, and can cause severe respiratory illnesses and other health  complications, including post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. This study explored the  antiviral potential of Brazilian green propolis, a natural product rich in  flavonoids and phenolic compounds encapsulated in a microemulsion, to enhance  its stability and antiviral effects. Brazilian green propolis extract was  encapsulated in a microemulsion (ME-GP) and characterized using various  physicochemical techniques. Furthermore, the antiviral and anti-inflammatory  activities of ME-GP was evaluated in vitro and ex-vivo against SARS-CoV-2. For  this, cells or tonsils were treated with ME-GP followed by infection with  SARS-CoV-2. The microemulsion showed a size of approximately 217 nm, negative  zeta potential, high encapsulation efficiency for artepillin C and baccharin (<  99%), and a spherical morphology. The ME-GP formulation was evaluated for  antiviral activity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan, Gamma, Delta,  and Omicron) in Caco-2 cells. The results demonstrated a significant reduction  in viral load, particularly for the Wuhan and Delta variants, with up to a 99%  reduction in viral load under prophylactic treatment conditions.  Time-of-addition assays revealed that ME-GP acts at an early stage in the viral  life cycle, likely by interfering with viral entry or immediate post-entry  events. Additionally, ME-GP was evaluated in human tonsils, demonstrating an 80%  reduction in viral load, suggesting its potential to reduce the transmission and  progression of infection. Furthermore, ME-GP exhibited anti-inflammatory  activity in human tonsils, significantly decreasing IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and  TNF-β levels. Thus, this study highlights the promising prophylactic and  therapeutic potential of nanoencapsulated green propolis for combating  SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, providing a natural adjunct in COVID-19 therapy.  © 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  After COVID-19 infection, some patients develop a post-COVID condition (PCC)  that is popularly referred to as long COVID. Among its symptoms is persistent  cognitive dysfunction that is potentially linked to altered brain functional  connectivity (FC). While research has explored functional reorganization in  patients with PCC, the intra- and inter- network connectivity and its  relationship with cognitive status and clinical outcomes remain unclear. In this  study, we recruited 121 individuals with PCC (67 with, and 54 without, cognitive  impairment), 20 months after infection, along with 37 non-infected healthy  controls from the NAUTILUS Project (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs: NCT05307549 and  NCT05307575). Participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance  imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Resting-state networks  were characterized using independent component analyses, dual regression and  network modelling for individual FC characterization. Group differences in  intra- and inter-network FC, and their associations with clinical and  neuropsychological data, were studied. Significance was set at a corrected  p-value of < 0.05. Patients with PCC showed increased intra-network FC in 10  cognitively relevant networks, including the default mode, salience, executive  control, auditory and basal ganglia networks, correlating positively with  general cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores), time since infection,  fatigue and subjective memory failures. Increased inter-network FC between  default mode and sensorimotor networks was also observed. Increases in FC may  reflect an inefficient compensatory mechanism in patients with PCC, associated  with fatigue, subjective memory complaints and persistence of PCC.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Sequelae of the acute phase of coronavirus disease-19, termed long  COVID, are characterised by numerous indicators, including neurological  symptoms. Functional neurological disorder (FND) can occur with or without  various structural diseases. No previous study has examined the relationship  between long COVID and FND, with positive signs for FND. This study confirmed  positive signs of functional limb weakness (hereafter positive signs) in  patients with long COVID. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective, single-centre study at an  outpatient clinic conducted from 1 June 2021 to 31 May 2024. We collected  patients' clinical data, including positive signs. The primary outcome was the  prevalence of positive signs. Patients with positive signs were followed up over  2 months, and subjective patient perceptions of symptomatic improvements and  changes in positive signs were analysed. RESULTS: Overall, 502 were diagnosed with long COVID, and 100 assessed patients  had positive signs. Female sex, time of infection after 2022, comorbidity of  psychiatric diseases, fatigue, headache and muscle weakness were statistically  significant in patients with positive signs compared with those in patients  without positive signs. 89 patients (41 with positive signs and 48 without  positive signs) were followed up, and 28 (68.3%) with positive signs and 33  (68.8%) without positive signs reported improvements. Positive signs disappeared  in patients with symptomatic improvements but not in patients without  symptomatic improvements (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive signs were found in over one-third of patients (33.9%) who  were investigated in this study. Some positive signs disappeared concurrently  with their symptomatic improvement.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Long-COVID, identified in approximately 15% of symptomatic  cases of COVID-19 in Spain, is a chronic multiorgan disease characterised by  persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnoea, and cognitive difficulties. This  study aims to evaluate the relationship between fatigue, perceived social  support, and symptomatology in Spanish patients with Long-COVID, with the  objective of identifying variables that contribute to holistic care. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATION: An observational, descriptive,  cross-sectional study was conducted with a non-randomised sample of 374 patients  belonging to Spanish associations of Long-COVID patients. It was conducted using  self-administered questionnaires distributed between July and November 2022  through associations of patients with Long-COVID. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: Ethical evaluation was requested by the research  ethics committee of the Eastern Area of Valladolid, which granted approval with  registration number PI-22-2747. RESEARCH METHODS: A total of 374 individuals who met specific criteria,  including proficiency in Spanish and persistent symptoms, participated.  Sociodemographic variables, persistent symptomatology, levels of fatigue (FSS  scale), and perceived social support (DUKE-UNC-11 scale) were assessed.  Descriptive statistical analysis, linear regression, and logistic analysis were  employed to determine associations between variables. RESULTS: The sample predominantly consisted of women (79.9%) with a mean age of  47 years. Neurological symptoms (79.4%) and pain (75.9%) were the most  prevalent. Notably, 54.5% of participants experienced severe fatigue, which was  negatively correlated with perceived social support. Conversely, perceived  social support exhibited a significant association with neurological, psychic,  and pain symptoms. Additionally, variables such as age and fatigue level  predicted affective and confidential social support. CONCLUSION: Fatigue and pain are associated with low perceptions of social  support, underscoring the necessity of integrating psychosocial assessments into  care protocols for patients with Long-COVID. An approach focused on perceived  social support could enhance the adaptation of these patients, contributing to a  more comprehensive and personalised model of care.  © 2025 The Author(s).

Long COVID, previously known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), refers  to prolonged symptoms or diagnosable conditions following COVID-19 infection.  The neuropsychiatric profile of Long COVID patients remains ambiguous. This  study aimed to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in a retrospective cohort of  Long COVID patients (N = 162) at a Rehabilitation Medicine clinic in South  Texas. Clinical data from patient records were used to calculate a Symptom  Score, and screening tools for stress/PTSD (PCL-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety  (GAD-7), and quality of life (SWL) were employed to evaluate if Long COVID  duration and severity could predict neuropsychiatric outcomes. The majority were  female (71%) and Hispanics (53%) who presented for treatment of Long COVID  symptoms during the study period, including fatigue (93%), coughing/shortness of  breath (81%), fever (67%), anosmia (58%), ageusia (54%), and weight loss (56%).  A minority of participants were hospitalized (N = 49) or required ventilator  support (N = 5) during acute infection. There was a high burden of  neuropsychiatric symptoms, including subjective cognitive impairment (79%),  headache (74%), and insomnia (58%). Symptom Score (median = 9, IQR [8,11]) was  significantly correlated with increased depression (PHQ-9; p < 0.05), anxiety  (GAD-7; p < 0.05) and elevated stress/PTSD (PCL-5; p < 0.05) symptoms. Long  COVID patients taking stimulants or mood stabilizers had higher GAD-7 (p <  0.031, p < 0.035) and PHQ-9 (p < 0.034, p < 0.009) scores but not PCL-5 scores.  Importantly, duration of Long COVID symptomatology also did not predict PCL-5  scores. No patient factors (e.g., sex, age, BMI, ethnicity) mediated Symptom  Score. Nonetheless, historically marginalized groups, such as women and  Hispanics, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This study is the  first to utilize validated screening tools to determine the presence and  severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Long COVID patients. These findings may  guide clinical management and future research on Long COVID, especially in  historically excluded populations.  DOI: 10.1101/2024.11.03.24316669 PMCID: PMC12204276 PMID: 40585077"

Exercise Intolerance and Response to Training in Patients With Postacute  Sequelae of SARS-CoV2 (Long COVID): A Scientific Statement From the American  Heart Association.  Cornwell WK, Levine BD, Baptiste D, Bhave N, Desai S, Dineen E, Durstenfeld M,  Edward J, Huang M, Jacobsen R, Kim JH, Spatz E; American Heart Association  Exercise, Cardiac Rehabilitation, and Secondary Prevention Committee of the  Council on Clinical Cardiology; Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing;  Council on Hypertension; Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health;  Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease; and Stroke Council.  The postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, also known as Long COVID, may affect 10%  to 25% of individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. More than 100 symptoms have  been reported among patients with Long COVID, but almost all patients report  severe fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, shortness of breath, and reductions in  exercise tolerance. Emerging data suggest that cardiovascular deconditioning  plays a major role in the development of this syndrome and that reductions in  functional capacity among patients with Long COVID are comparable to reductions  seen among individuals with cardiovascular deconditioning resulting from bed  rest. Concern has been raised about the use of exercise training as part of the  management strategy for patients with Long COVID. However, exercise training  appropriately tailored to the patient with cardiovascular deconditioning may be  an effective strategy to facilitate improvement in symptoms. This American Heart  Association scientific statement provides a concise yet comprehensive overview  of mechanisms contributing to development of Long COVID and methods by which  exercise training may be applied to this unique patient population to alleviate  symptoms and improve quality of life. In addition, methods of reintroducing  exercise and return to play among athletes affected by COVID-19 are discussed.  DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000001348 PMID: 40583757"

Electronic address: chinjung@cgmh.org.tw.  BACKGROUND: This study assessed the prevalence and severity of neurological and  psychiatric long COVID symptoms among healthcare workers (HCWs) based on their  COVID-19 status, aiming to unravel the complexities associated with post-acute  sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A cohort of 467 HCWs from a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan, who  received at least three doses of COVID-19 vaccines, were surveyed for long COVID  symptoms. Participants were categorized into symptomatic (n = 224), asymptomatic  (n = 21), and absence of COVID-19 (n = 222) groups based on diagnostic criteria  involving questionnaire responses, medical records, and anti-nucleoprotein  antibody data. Through a comprehensive set of questionnaires, symptoms, memory  dysfunction, anxiety, and depression were rigorously evaluated and statistically  analyzed for group comparisons. RESULTS: Despite meticulous data collection, the study revealed no statistically  significant differences in the severity of neurological and psychiatric long  COVID symptoms across the COVID-19 status groups. Noteworthy trends were  observed, including higher instances of memory problems worsening over time,  elevated anxiety levels in symptomatic cases, and subtle indicators of increased  depression severity in this subgroup. The findings underscored the  multifactorial nature of long COVID manifestations and the impact of COVID-19  history on reported symptoms. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted potential biases in symptom reporting that may  inflate long COVID prevalence estimates. While the robust methodology shed light  on diverse health profiles among HCWs, future research should focus on  longitudinal designs and objective diagnostic measures to provide more accurate  assessments of long COVID's burden.

Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging  symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The  pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation  proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been  inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the  Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV)  patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were  compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract  infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals  with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three  months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers  and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram,  Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the  severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We  observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients  over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month  6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade  inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory  biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune  normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the  immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our  predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in  combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well  the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related  biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically  over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the  presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent  biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by  WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have  primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our  results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent  role in the later stages.

Emerging evidence highlights the profound and lasting impact of severe illnesses  such as COVID-19, particularly among individuals with underlying comorbidities.  Patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM) are  disproportionately affected, facing heightened risks of both disease  exacerbation and the onset of new complications. Notably, the convergence of  advanced age and DM has been consistently associated with poor COVID-19  outcomes. However, the long-term metabolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection,  especially its role in disrupting glucose homeostasis and potentially triggering  or worsening DM, remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current  clinical and experimental findings to clarify the bidirectional relationship  between COVID-19 and diabetes. We critically examine literature reporting  deterioration of glycemic control, onset of hyperglycemia in previously  non-diabetic individuals, and worsening of metabolic parameters in diabetic  patients after infection. Furthermore, we explore proposed mechanistic pathways,  including pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and  immune-mediated damage, that may underpin the development or progression of DM  in the post-COVID setting. Collectively, this work underscores the urgent need  for continued research and clinical vigilance in managing metabolic health in  COVID-19 survivors.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 can affect the central nervous system directly  or indirectly. AD shares several similarities with long COVID cognitive  impairment on a molecular and imaging level, as well as common risk factors. The  objective of this review is to evaluate the incidence of post-acute COVID-19  cognitive impairment. Secondarily, we aim to determine if neuroinflammation in  COVID-19 survivors may be associated with the onset of neurological disease,  with a focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: literature search up to March 2025 on the prevalence of cognitive  deficits in COVID-19 survivors, underlying pathophysiology and associations with  neurological disorders. RESULTS: a wide array of neuropsychiatric manifestations is associated with  COVID-19; executive function, memory, and attention are the most frequently  reported neurocognitive deficits, regardless of COVID-19 severity. There are  associations between the risks for cognitive deficits post-infection with the  age of the patients and the severity of the disease. Increasing evidence  suggests that neurocognitive deficits are associated with the onset of  neurological and neuropsychiatric disease in COVID-19 survivors. CONCLUSIONS: clinicians caring for COVID-19 survivors should actively  investigate neurocognitive sequelae, particularly for patients with increased  risk for cognitive deficits.

SARS-CoV-2 infection increases long-term risk of pneumonia in an urban  population: an observational cohort study up to 46 months post-infection.  Duong KS(1), Henry SS(1), Duong TQ(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore  Medical Center, Bronx, New York, United States of America.  BACKGROUND: COVID-19 could increase susceptibility to future pulmonary  infections. Given the sheer number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2,  increased prevalence of future pulmonary infections could be a public health  concern. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to determine whether COVID-19 is  associated with increased incidence of future pneumonia. In an urban population  in Montefiore Health System in the Bronx between 03/1/2020 and 01/31/2024, there  were 64,376 patients with a prior history of COVID-19, 1.2 million patients  without (controls), and 8468 patients with influenza without COVID-19. Controls  were propensity-matched. Multivariate Cox adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95%  confidence interval (CI) accounting for confounders were calculated. Outcomes  were also analyzed with respect to comorbidities, median incomes, insurance  status, and unmet social needs. RESULTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 (aHR=3.69, 95%CI[3.29,4.15]) and non-hospitalized  COVID-19 (aHR=1.40[1.27,1.55]) patients had higher risk of developing future  pneumonia compared to controls. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients experienced more  recurrent pneumonia episodes (2.3 cases/patient, p<0.05) compared to  non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (1.93 cases/patient, p<0.05), who also had a  higher rate of recurrence than the control group (1.71 cases/patient).  Individuals on Medicaid (aHR=1.40 [1.26,1.55]), Medicare (aHR=2.39 [2.12,2.69])  (relative to private insurance) or with unmet social needs (aHR=1.34  [1.12,1.60]) were at even higher risks of outcomes. Hospitalized COVID-19  patients had a higher adjusted risk of outcomes compared to the influenza  patients (aHR=2.89, 95% CI [2.26, 3.69]). Risk of outcomes varied by COVID-19  variants/waves. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of new-onset pneumonia.  Patients with lower socioeconomic status or unmet needs were at higher risk.  © The Author(s) 2025.

Post-COVID-19 is a chronic infection-related syndrome, including exacerbations  of pre-existing or newly diagnosed conditions that have been established after  the acute phase of COVID-19 and have demonstrated a wide range of systemic  effects beyond the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to its receptor,  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Transmembrane serine protease 2  (TMPRSS2) facilitates viral entry and spread. ACE-2 receptors are detectable in  several tissues, including the respiratory mucosa, digestive tract, heart,  kidney, and brain. Several investigations have demonstrated an increase in  digestive manifestations post-acute COVID-19, likely related to an alteration in  the intestinal microbiota following infection. These changes can lead to a loss  of species diversity, resulting in an overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens and  deprivation of commensal bacteria. In this context, post-infection irritable  bowel syndrome shows an increased incidence compared to controls. Growing  evidence also suggests the enduring presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut tissue.  Studies are ongoing to investigate antiviral agents that counteract prolonged  COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, the objectives of this review were to summarize  the digestive manifestations, focusing on irritable bowel syndrome and  therapeutic strategies. This review gives an overview of studies published in  English in the last two years on the PubMed database.

INTRODUCTION: 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection  with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with  mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery.  Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include,  among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction.  Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained  activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of  specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS  disease on monocyte subpopulations. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into  this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological  parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy  donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by  flow cytometry. RESULTS: PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes,  whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes  were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without  fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies.  However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of  non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. DISCUSSION: This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the  peripheral blood of patients with PACS.

OBJECTIVES: Significant heterogeneity has been reported in cohort studies  evaluating the impact of antiviral treatment on long-term sequelae following  COVID-19 hospitalization. We evaluated the impact of i.v. remdesivir on the risk  of subsequent long-term cardiovascular/neurological/respiratory/autoimmune  diagnoses and persistent symptoms. METHODS: National COVID-19 registries and health care claims databases were  utilized to construct a retrospective population-based cohort enrolling all  adult Singaporeans hospitalized for COVID-19 (September 1, 2021-July 31, 2023)  who fulfilled criteria for intravenous remdesivir. The cohort was divided into  remdesivir-treated and untreated groups, with between group differences in  baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics adjusted using overlap  weighting. Risks of long-term new-incident (31-300 days) diagnoses/symptoms  across cardiovascular/neurological/respiratory/autoimmune systems were compared  across untreated/treated groups via competing-risks regression. RESULTS: A total of 30 175 COVID-19 hospitalizations were included in the cohort  for evaluating risk of long-term sequelae; 37.6% (11 353/30 175) received  remdesivir. A total of 88.9% of the cohort were fully vaccinated, and 60.5% had  received a booster dose; 77.4% were infected during Omicron. The risk of  long-term new-onset diagnoses across cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory,  and autoimmune systems (any long-term diagnosis, adjusted hazards ratio = 1.08  [95% CI, 0.97-1.20]) up to 300 days post-COVID-19-hospitalization was not  significantly different in the remdesivir-treated group versus untreated  individuals across age and vaccination subgroups. Similarly, no significant  difference in the incidence of long-term symptom persistence at 300 days  post-COVID-19 hospitalization was observed in the remdesivir-treated group  versus untreated individuals. DISCUSSION: Receipt of remdesivir did not significantly reduce risk of long-term  multisystemic sequelae or long-term symptoms in a boosted cohort of adult  Singaporeans hospitalized with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cultural barriers and perceptual factors that are  peculiar among Africans are known to limit the number of people seeking medical  care for post-COVID conditions. The aim of this social media survey was to  ascertain the burden of post-COVID neurologic complications in Nigeria in  individuals with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional web-based survey of persons with  PCR-confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nigeria with incident  infection between March 2020 and April 2022. Our survey utilized Kobo Toolbox®  and was disseminated via several online platforms (including WhatsApp ®,  Facebook®, and Twitter (X)®). Participant demographics, COVID-19 symptom  profile, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and the occurrence of persistent neurological  symptoms were documented. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 963 participants with confirmed or suspected  COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 36.9 ± 9.9 years, and 555/963 (57.6%) were  female. Only 174/963 individuals (18.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation at any  point during the pandemic, of which 133 (76.4%) had accompanying symptoms  consistent with the case definition. A total of 47/174 (27.0%) of the  PCR-positive participants reported post-acute COVID symptoms, and 46/174 (26.4%)  had post-COVID neurologic complaints. The most commonly reported symptoms were  fatigue (25; 14.4%), generalized body weakness (22; 12.6%), and difficulty  remembering things (15; 8.6%). Slightly over half of those with post-COVID  symptoms (25/47; 53.2%) sought care, with 21/25 (84%) presenting to a medical  facility. Others presented either to a community pharmacy (1/25) or a patent  medicine store (3/25) for care. CONCLUSION: Despite low testing rates in Nigeria, the prevalence of post-COVID  neurologic complications is approximately 1 in 4 individuals. Further studies on  the prognosis and management of post-COVID neurologic sequelae in Nigeria are  warranted.  Publisher: CONTEXTE ET OBJECTIF: Les barrières culturelles et les facteurs  perceptuels propres aux Africains sont connus pour limiter le nombre de  personnes recherchant des soins médicaux pour les affections postCOVID.  L'objectif de cette enquête sur les réseaux sociaux était de déterminer la  charge des complications neurologiques post-COVID au Nigeria chez les individus  avec un COVID-19 confirmé. MÉTHODES: Nous avons mené une enquête transversale en ligne auprès de personnes  au Nigeria ayant une infection confirmée ou suspectée par PCR au SARS-CoV-2,  survenue entre mars 2020 et avril 2022. Notre enquête a utilisé Kobo Toolbox® et  a été diffusée sur plusieurs plateformes en ligne (notamment WhatsApp®,  Facebook® et Twitter (X)®). Les données recueillies comprenaient les  caractéristiques démographiques des participants, le profil des symptômes du  COVID-19, les résultats des tests SARS-CoV-2 et la survenue de symptômes  neurologiques persistants. RÉSULTATS: Nous avons analysé les données de 963 participants ayant une  infection confirmée ou suspectée par le COVID-19. L'âge moyen était de 36,9 ±  9,9 ans, et 555/963 (57,6 %) étaient des femmes. Seuls 174/963 individus (18,1  %) avaient une confirmation PCR du SARS-CoV-2 à un moment donné pendant la  pandémie, parmi lesquels 133 (76,4 %) présentaient des symptômes compatibles  avec la définition de cas. Un total de 47/174 (27,0 %) des participants positifs  à la PCR ont signalé des symptômes post-COVID aigus, et 46/174 (26,4 %) ont  rapporté des plaintes neurologiques post-COVID. Les symptômes les plus  fréquemment signalés étaient la fatigue (25 ; 14,4 %), la faiblesse généralisée  (22 ; 12,6 %) et les troubles de la mémoire (15 ; 8,6 %). Un peu plus de la  moitié des personnes présentant des symptômes post-COVID (25/47 ; 53,2 %) ont  recherché des soins, dont 21/25 (84 %) dans une structure médicale. Les autres  ont consulté soit une pharmacie communautaire (1/25), soit un magasin de  médicaments brevetés (3/25). CONCLUSION: Malgré le faible taux de tests au Nigeria, la prévalence des  complications neurologiques post-COVID est d'environ un individu sur quatre.  D'autres études sur le pronostic et la prise en charge des séquelles  neurologiques post-COVID au Nigeria sont nécessaires.

Multiple treatments  have been proposed but efficacy is inadequately investigated. Hyperbaric oxygen  therapy (HBOT) has been promoted based on a small number of publications. As  there is potential for a placebo effect and the financial cost of HBOT is high,  we sought to investigate the effects of HBOT in Long COVID in a randomised  trial. METHODS: We randomised 101 patients into four treatment groups, receiving 10  sessions of oxygen 'treatment' inside a pressure chamber, according to one of  four modalities: A - 100% oxygen at 253 kPa (2.5 atmospheres absolute); B - 40%  oxygen at 253 kPa; C - 100% oxygen at 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere absolute); D - 21%  oxygen at 101.3 kPa. Groups B and C thus received a similar effective oxygen  dose of 101.3 kPa. Quality of life symptom scores (Visual Analogue Scale;  EQ-5D-5L, C19-YRSm), a 6-minute walking test and five neurocognitive tests were  administered before and after the treatment series. At three months  post-treatment, a telephone questionnaire probed for lasting effects. RESULTS: All groups were comparable with regards to demographics, Long COVID  symptoms and severity. After treatment, there were no significant differences in  subjective symptoms, functional scores, and cognitive performance between any  groups. The response to treatment was highly variable, with some patients in  even the 'placebo' group D reporting a significant improvement in their  well-being. This was not reflected in any objective outcome scores. No subgroups  of patients responded better to any of the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant effect from different doses of oxygen in a  hyperbaric chamber. It is possible that the very modest improvements reported in  other studies were due to a placebo effect. Claims that HBOT has a significant  effect on Long COVID need further investigation before indiscriminately  prescribing or promoting HBOT.

(#)Contributed equally  PURPOSE: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) has emerged as a major  healthcare problem. A comprehensive mechanism of disease remains to be  elucidated. In this study we aimed to explore pulmonary and muscle fibroblast  activation protein (FAP) activity in former critical COVID-19 patients with  persistent dyspnea, using [68Ga]FAPI-46 PET/CT. METHODS: In this single center prospective observational study we included  former critical COVID-19 patients reporting complaints of dyspnea > 3 months  after hospital discharge. A [68Ga]FAPI PET/CT scan was performed including a  high-resolution CT scan, lung function test, EQ-5D questionnaire, 6 min walking  test and inflammatory markers. Age and sex-matched subjects, without pulmonary  pathology, served as controls. The [68Ga]FAPI uptake was corrected for lean body  mass and the target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen PASC patients and 15 controls (median age 59 and 63 years and  BMI of 34.6 and 25.2 kg/m2) were included. The interval between hospital  discharge and study visit was 30 months. Increased pulmonary FAP expression was  observed in PASC, (TBR 0.79 ± 0.23) compared to controls (TBR 0.40 ± 0.13,  P < 0.001). Increased FAP expression was also observed in the paravertebral  muscles (PASC: TBR 1.17 and controls TBR 1.00, P = 0.03). Forced expiratory  volume and forced vital capacity showed moderate negative correlation with the  pulmonary TBR, while the percentage of ground glass opacities showed a moderate  positive correlation. CONCLUSION: [68Ga]FAPI PET/CT demonstrated elevated FAP expression in PASC.

COVID-19 has been linked to acute and long-term cognitive impairments, including  memory and concentration deficits, as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms such as  anxiety and depression. However, the neuropathophysiological mechanisms  underlying these cognitive and affective changes remain poorly understood.  Accumulating evidence points towards neuroinflammation as a potential driver of  most acute and post-acute neurofunctional symptoms. In this study, we aimed to  comprehensively characterize cognitive impairment associated with COVID-19 using  a large online cohort of over 1400 participants, including individuals reporting  a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and individuals who had never been tested  positive. Our cognitive test battery covered alertness, executive functions, and  episodic long-term memory. Our results demonstrate a pronounced and selective  impairment of individuals previously infected in a mnemonic discrimination task  known to engage hippocampus-dependent pattern separation. This impairment  remained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounding  factors (i.e., age, gender, education, depressiveness, anxiety, and stress).  This finding, derived indirectly from behavioral performance, suggests  compromised hippocampal neurogenesis following infection, which may contribute  to COVID-related memory deficits. Our study has important implications for  understanding the neurofunctional consequences of COVID-19 and highlights the  potential significance of neuroinflammation in the manifestation of cognitive  impairments.  © 2025.

Studies in large cohorts exposed to the same triggers associated with  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and the follow-up of post-acute outcomes  may uncover the pathomechanisms of autoimmune conditions and EBV-related cancer.  We investigated a large cohort of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection  reporting long COVID (LC) symptoms for positive serological markers of recent  EBV reactivation (viral capsid antigen [VCA] immunoglobulin [Ig]M, VCA IgA, and  early antigen D IgG), host interleukin (IL)1 and IL10 genetics, and immune  response. Recent EBV reactivation occurs more frequently in individuals with a  genetic risk of EBV reactivation in the IL1RN, IL1A, and IL1B genes associated  with an elevated ratio of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)/IL-1β and a higher  latent EBV load in blood. High levels of anti-VCA IgA serve as a strong marker  of recent EBV reactivation, which is associated with objective long-term  pulmonary dysfunction in LC. Our data highlight the association between host IL1  genetics and EBV reactivation.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BackgroundLong COVID patients report various cognitive and affective symptoms  that are poorly understood.ObjectiveThis study analyzed cognitive and affective  performance in 208 Long COVID patients pre and post psychoeducational  rehabilitation using a standardized screening test of higher cerebral functions.  Identifying persistent difficulties may help guide future rehabilitation  efforts.MethodsThe sample was comprised by a subset of 208 who completed  psychoeducational rehabilitation from 614 Long COVID patients seeking  rehabilitation. Performance on specific items was analyzed and compared to a  reference sample of 114 educationally matched normal functioning  adults.ResultsDetailed item analyses in 208 patients revealed persistent  difficulties in the efficiency of learning and memory, affective expression, and  the ability to accurately predict verbal memory performance compared to a  reference sample. Long COVID patients showed variable performance deficits on  attention, visual-spatial problem solving and memory measures. Language and  related functions were consistently at a level commensurate with normally  functioning individuals.ConclusionsPersistent cognitive and affective  impairments were identified in Long COVID patients post-rehabilitation. Future  programs should aim on to improve the efficiency of learning and memory, enhance  the range of affective expression, and improve self-awareness of functional  capacities. Rehabilitation should consider the multifactorial causes of these  neuropsychological symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: We performed a multidimensional analysis of mood, cognition, sleep  and circadian rhythms in patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2  infection (PASC) with the objective of characterizing the phenotype of PASC  fatigue. METHODS: We recruited adult patients from a Neuro-COVID-19 Clinic with  persistence of disabling symptoms beyond 6 weeks from acute infection.  Self-reported symptoms were assessed with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement  Information System instruments. We evaluated cognitive performance using NIH  Toolbox measures and assessed sleep and rest-activity rhythms by 7 days of wrist  actigraphy. We performed level 2 polysomnography in a subset of 20 participants. RESULTS: We studied 58 participants: 83% White, 59% female and 91% not  hospitalized for COVID-19. Fatigue severity was significantly correlated with  worse self-reported cognitive abilities but not with objectively measured  cognitive performance and with greater depression symptoms, several  rest-activity rhythm and light exposure disruption measures, and greater  actigraphy measured sleep time and time in bed. A multivariable model found  significant, independent associations between fatigue severity and subjective  cognitive abilities, depression symptoms, and rest-activity rhythm disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Long total sleep times, disruption of light exposure and circadian  rest-activity patterns, depression and subjective cognitive impairment are  associated with PASC fatigue. Behaviorally influenced sleep and circadian  abnormalities may exacerbate fatigue and be targets for therapeutic  interventions.  DOI: 10.1080/15402002.2025.2522671 PMCID: PMC12212387 PMID: 40537100"

Azzarone B(1), Landolina N(1), Mariotti FR(1), Moretta L(1), Maggi E(1).  Author information: (1)Tumor Immunology Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.  The soluble S1 subunit of Spike protein (SP) from the SARS-CoV-2 of different  variants of concern (VOCs) may directly bind and activate human NK cells in  vitro through the engagement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. This  mechanism revealed a novel pathogenic role played by NK cells not only in the  different phases of disease but also in the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19  (PASC) and some post-vaccination side effects. In addition to its binding to  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates virus attachment and cell  entry, soluble SP triggers several active receptors/molecules expressed by many  cells, inducing, in turn, type I/III interferon decrease, altered autophagy and  apoptosis, the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, complement  activation and endothelial damage, which favour clotting events. In this review,  we discuss the hypothesis that circulating SP, exerting multiple biological  activities, can explain the heterogeneity of the clinical outcomes of severe  COVID-19, PASC and post-vaccine-related effects. Recent reports have clearly  indicated that soluble SARS-CoV-2 and post-vaccination SP trigger the same  cascade of events, acting on the immune response and promoting defined adverse  events. Factors hindering the pathological activity of soluble SP are the SP  plasma levels, the age of the infected/vaccinated people and the efficiency of  protein synthesis of ectopic targets triggered by soluble SP, as well as the  specificity, the titre and the affinity of anti-SP antibodies elicited by the  infection. At present, the risk/benefit ratio is largely in favour of  vaccination; however, the excessive and persistent ectopic production of  synthetic SP should be systematically analysed. This would allow for the  identification of subjects at risk for major adverse events and to answer the  urgent need for efficient vaccines that provide long-lasting activity with  minimal side effects.

The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a significant global health burden, leading to  various long-term consequences, including persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms  in a substantial proportion of infected individuals. This study investigates the  role of the purinergic receptor P2X7 in mediating behaviour changes in a mouse  model of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). We show that  infection with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain induces anxiety- and  depression-like behaviours in male mice, associated with elevated P2X7 receptor  expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as increased IFN-γ  levels in the striatum. To assess the therapeutic potential of P2X7 antagonism,  we administered the selective P2X7 antagonist JNJ 47965567 in vivo. Pretreatment  with JNJ 47965567 mitigated the behavioural changes and reduced IFN-γ levels,  suggesting a potential therapeutic role for P2X7 antagonists in the management  of post-COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our findings support the involvement of  neuroinflammation in the symptoms of PASC and highlight the P2X7 pathway as a  potential innovative therapeutic target for alleviating anxiety and depression  in affected individuals and in other sequelae of post-viral neuropsychiatric  conditions.

Author information: (1)Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, CNRS UMR8104, Université Paris-Cité, Paris,  France.  Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), i.e., long-lasting pathologies subsequent  to infections that do not properly resolve, have both a common core and a broad  diversity of manifestations. PAIS include a group of core symptoms (pathological  fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and pain) accompanied by a large  set of diverse symptoms. Core and diverse additional symptoms, which can persist  for years, exhibiting periods of relapses and remissions, usually start suddenly  after an apparently common infection. PAIS display highly variable clinical  features depending on the nature of the initial pathogen, and to an even larger  extent, on the diversity of preexisting individual terrains in which PAIS are  rooted. In a first part, I discuss biological issues related to the persistence  of microbial antigens, dysregulated immune responses, reactivation of latent  viruses, different potential self-sustained inflammatory loops, mitochondrial  dysfunction, metabolic disorders in the tryptophan- kynurenin pathway (TKP) with  impact on serotonin, and consequences of a dysfunctional bidirectional  microbiota-gut-brain axis. The second part deals with the nervous system  dependence of PAIS. I rely on the concept of interoception, the process by which  the brain senses, integrates and interprets signals originating from within the  body, and sends feebacks aimed at maintaining homeostasis. Interoception is  central for understanding the origin of fatigue, dysautonomia, dysfunctioning of  the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and its relation with stress,  inflammation or depression. I propose that all individual predispositions  leading to self-sustained vicious circles constitute building blocks that can  self-assemble in many possible ways, to give rise to both core and diverse  features of PAIS. A useful discrimination between different PAIS subtypes should  be obtained with a composite profiling including biomarkers, questionnaires and  functional tests so as to take into account PAIS multidimensionality.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate determinants of post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) clinic  attendance among participants not hospitalised versus hospitalised during the  SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six population-based registers with high coverage to cover all adults  residing in Stockholm County, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Adults residing in Stockholm County on 31 January 2020, with a  SARS-CoV-2 infection through 30 November 2022, who did not die or move out of  Stockholm County within 90 days. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: PCC clinic attendance from 90 days after the  SARS-CoV-2 test until date of death, date of moving out, or 30 November 30,2023. RESULTS: Of non-hospitalised and hospitalised participants, 737 of 464 674  (0.2%) and 433 of 23 374 (1.9%), respectively, attended a PCC clinic. A total of  75 878 (16.3%) of non-hospitalised participants and 6190 (26.5%) of hospitalised  participants presented with new-onset symptoms that could indicate PCC in  primary care. The strongest determinants of attendance among non-hospitalised  participants were mental health disorder (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.57, 95% CI  2.21 to 2.98), asthma (2.39, 1.97-2.92) and >4 PCC symptoms in 2019 (2.27,  1.60-3.24), and among hospitalised participants were >31 sick days in 2019  (1.94, 1.47-2.56), 1-30 sick days in 2019 (1.56, 1.06-2.29) and obesity (1.51,  1.19-1.93). The most common clinical presentation was fatigue (n=526, 71.4%)  among non-hospitalised and dyspnoea (n=148, 34.2%) among hospitalised  participants. CONCLUSIONS: PCC clinic attendance characteristics differed between  non-hospitalised and hospitalised participants. Distinguishing PCC from  conditions with overlapping symptoms and determining the appropriate level of  care may be challenging, with risk of resource displacement effects and  inappropriate care.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as  post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global  health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and  clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged  post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months  following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included  intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and  anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with  assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on  mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed  using the ARTIC protocol. RESULTS: We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of  which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients.  Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes  involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9  signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic  inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving  mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting  mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs  of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed  in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels  in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion,  suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find  differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when  comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants  with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron  variant was prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a  persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up  of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID  is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling  suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.  Copyright © 2025 Fineschi, Klar, Lopez Egido, Schuster, Bergquist, Kaden and  Dahl.

(#)Contributed equally  INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 virus resulted in significant disability and  diagnostic challenges among patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19  (PASC). Here, we assessed microvascular perfusion, clotting, and autoimmune  responses to lung targets in PASC patients compared to healthy controls with the  aim of explaining the persistent respiratory symptoms of patients with PASC. METHODS: We performed a blinded case-control study of 20 PASC patients with  persistent respiratory symptoms versus 20 healthy controls previously infected  with SARS-CoV-2 virus. We assessed lung perfusion using Technetium-99m  macroaggregated albumin (MAA) SPECT-CT scans, clotting using coagulation and  thromboelastrogram (TEG) tests, and autoimmunity to vascular and lung antigens  using ELISA assays. RESULTS: Subjective respiratory symptoms and quality-of-life measures were  significantly worse among the PASC patients compared with healthy controls  (p<0.001). Clinical symptoms among PASC patients were inversely correlated with  plasma total IgA levels (coefficient: -0.61, p=0.004) and with autoimmune IgA  recognizing pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell antigens (coefficient:  -0.51, p=0.02). Additionally, levels of total IgA were directly correlated with  fibrinogen and fibrin-related clot strength (coefficient: +0.52, p=0.02;  coefficient: +0.63, p=0.003). SPECT-CT scans were positive only among 25% of  PASC cases versus 10% of healthy controls (p=0.41). TEG tests showed no  differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our small study of PASC patients identified that circulating IgA  antibodies may correlate inversely with clinical symptoms and directly with  clotting parameters, suggesting a possible link between autoimmunity and  coagulation. However, many of the study's findings were null, which may mean  that tissue-level studies or alternative explanations of PASC need to be  explored.

BACKGROUND: Studies into the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long  COVID have been limited by retrospective pre-infection sleep data and infrequent  post-infection follow-up. We therefore used prospectively collected monthly data  to evaluate how pre-infection sleep characteristics affect risk of long COVID  and to track changes in sleep duration during the year after SARS-CoV-2  infection. METHODS: COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, population-based UK study of COVID-19 in  adults. We included non-hospitalised participants with evidence of SARS-CoV-2  infection and used logistic regression to estimate adjusted ORs for the  association between preinfection sleep characteristics and long COVID. We  assessed post-infection sleep duration using multilevel mixed models. We  collected sleep data from participants using a subset of questions from the  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We defined long COVID as unresolved symptoms at  least 12 weeks after infection. COVIDENCE UK is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04330599. RESULTS: We included 3994 participants in our long COVID risk analysis, of whom  327 (8.2%) reported long COVID. We found an inverse relationship between  pre-infection sleep quality and risk of long COVID (medium vs good quality: OR  1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.81; medium-low vs good: 1.55, 1.12 to 2.16; low vs good:  1.94, 1.11 to 3.38). Greater variability in pre-infection sleep efficiency was  also associated with long COVID when adjusted for infection severity (OR per  percentage-point increase 1.07, 1.02 to 1.12). We assessed post-infection sleep  duration in 6860 participants, observing a 0.11 hour (95% CI 0.09 to 0.14)  increase in the first month after infection compared with pre-infection, with  larger increases for more severe infections. After 1 month, sleep duration  largely returned to pre-infection levels, although fluctuations in duration  lasted up to 6 months after infection among people reporting long COVID. CONCLUSIONS: While poor-quality sleep before SARS-CoV-2 infection associates  with increased risk of long COVID thereafter, changes in sleep duration after  infection in these non-hospitalised cases were modest and generally quick to  resolve.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms emerged early in the COVID-19 pandemic as  a key feature of the virus, with research confirming a range of neuropsychiatric  manifestations linked to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the persistence of  neurological symptoms in the post-acute and chronic phases remains unclear. This  meta-analysis assesses the long-term neurological effects of COVID-19 in  recovered patients, providing insights for mental health service planning. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across five electronic  databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and CENTRAL, up to March 22,  2024. Studies evaluating the prevalence of long-term neurological symptoms in  COVID-19 survivors with at least six months of follow-up were included. Pooled  prevalence estimates, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were performed, and  publication bias was assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence rates for the different symptoms were as follows:  fatigue 43.3% (95% CI [36.1-50.9%]), memory disorders 27.8% (95% CI  [20.1-37.1%]), cognitive impairment 27.1% (95% CI [20.4-34.9%]), sleep disorders  24.4% (95% CI [18.1-32.1%]), concentration impairment 23.8% (95% CI  [17.2-31.9%]), headache 20.3% (95% CI [15-26.9%]), dizziness 16% (95% CI  [9.5-25.7%]), stress 15.9% (95% CI [10.2-24%]), depression 14.0% (95% CI  [10.1-19.2%]), anxiety 13.2% (95% CI [9.6-17.9%]), and migraine 13% (95% CI  [2.2-49.8%]). Significant heterogeneity was observed across all symptoms.  Meta-regression analysis showed higher stress, fatigue, and headache in females,  and increased stress and concentration impairment with higher BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common and persistent in COVID-19  survivors. This meta-analysis highlights the significant burden these symptoms  place on individuals, emphasizing the need for well-resourced multidisciplinary  healthcare services to support post-COVID recovery.

BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of COVID-19, known as post-acute sequelae of  SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), impair quality of life (QoL). This secondary  analysis of the ACTIV-4c clinical trial evaluates the specific effects of  extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban on individual QoL domains, assessed by  EQ-5D-5L index, in patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: ACTIV-4c study was a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind clinical trial. We enrolled 1,217 patients hospitalized with  COVID-19 at 107 U.S. hospitals between February 2021 and June 2022. Participants  were randomized to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or placebo for 30 days  post-discharge. QoL was assessed using EQ-5D-5L index at 2, 30, and 90 days  post-discharge, evaluating five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities,  pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Data were analyzed using chi-square  tests and proportional odds models adjusted for multiple variables. RESULTS: Of 1,217 participants, 610 received apixaban and 607 received placebo.  By 2 days post-discharge, 43.5% of apixaban and 45.0% of placebo recipients  reported moderate impairment in one or more EQ-5D-5L domains, particularly usual  activities (33.0%). At 30 days, moderate impairment persisted in 30.8% of  apixaban and 33.4% of placebo recipients, improving most in the usual activities  domain (17.4%). At 90 days, 31.5% of apixaban and 28.5% of placebo recipients  reported moderate impairment. Extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was not  associated with significant improvements in any EQ-5D-5L domains at 30 or 90  days. CONCLUSIONS: Extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban after COVID-19  hospitalization does not improve QoL. The high prevalence of QoL impairment  highlights the need for targeted interventions for PASC.  Copyright © 2025. Published by Elsevier Inc.  DOI: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2025.06.003 PMID: 40513753"

Author information: (1)Emeritus Professor of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston,  MA, USA. (2)Adjunct Faculty, Departments of Medicine and Nursing, Oregon Health Sciences,  Portland, OR, USA.  INTRODUCTION: Long COVID is a condition characterized by persistent unexplained  symptoms following COVID-19 infection. These symptoms are not related to another  disease or organ damage and are similar to those in fibromyalgia and myslgic  encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). AREAS COVERED: The similar clinical and pathophysiological features and  management of long COVID, fibromyalgia and ME/CFS are explored from the unifying  framework of central sensitivity syndromes. The article is based on a literature  search utilizing PubMed for content published between 2021 and 1 May 2025, using  search terms: long COVID, long COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19, post-acute  SARS-CoV-2, fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, post-exertional malaise and central  sensitization. EXPERT OPINION: Once long COVID is redefined to exclude patients with  well-defined organ disease, it fits best as a model of central sensitization.  Long COVID is a single syndrome, rather than many distinct diseases. Optimal  management of long COVID and similar central sensitivity syndromes should  include personalized care with a primary care led-multidisciplinary team.

Background: Long COVID can develop in individuals who have had COVID-19,  regardless of the severity of their initial infection or the treatment they  received. Several studies have examined the prevalence and manifestation of  symptom phenotypes to comprehend the pathophysiological mechanisms associated  with these symptoms. Numerous articles outlined specific approaches for  multidisciplinary management and treatment of these patients, focusing primarily  on those with mild acute illness. The various management models implemented  focused on a patient-centered approach, where the specialists were positioned  around the patient. On the other hand, the created pathways do not consider the  possibility of symptom clusters when determining how to define diagnostic  algorithms. Methods: This retrospective longitudinal study took place at the  ""Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"", Pavia, Italy (SMATTEO) and at the  ""Ospedale di Cremona"", ASST Cremona, Italy (CREMONA). Information was retrieved  from the administrative data warehouse and from two dedicated registries. We  included patients discharged with a diagnosis of severe COVID-19, systematically  invited for a 3-month follow-up visit. Unsupervised machine learning was used to  identify potential patient phenotypes. Results: Three hundred and eighty-two  patients were included in these analyses. About one-third of patients were older  than 65 years; a quarter were female; more than 80% of patients had  multi-morbidities. Diagnoses related to the circulatory system were the most  frequent, comprising 46% of cases, followed by endocrinopathies at 20%. PCA  (principal component analysis) had no clustering tendency, which was comparable  to the PCA plot of a random dataset. The unsupervised machine learning approach  confirms these findings. Indeed, while dendrograms for the hierarchical  clustering approach may visually indicate some clusters, this is not the case  for the PAM method. Notably, most patients were concentrated in one cluster.  Conclusions: The extreme heterogeneity of patients affected by post-acute  sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) has not allowed for the identification  of specific symptom clusters with the most recent statistical techniques, thus  preventing the generation of common diagnostic-therapeutic pathways.

Background/Objectives: Long COVID-19 is characterized by persistent symptoms  lasting three months or more following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nutrition has  emerged as a modifiable factor influencing recovery trajectories and symptom  burden; however, existing evidence remains fragmented across diverse study  designs and populations. This scoping review synthesized global evidence on the  role of diet and nutrition in managing long COVID-19 symptoms and supporting  recovery. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR and Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines  for scoping reviews, we searched major biomedical databases for studies  published between 2020 and 2025. Eligible studies examined dietary intake,  nutritional status, or nutrition-related interventions in adults with long  COVID-19. Results: After duplicates were removed, 1808 records were screened,  resulting in 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria-27 intervention studies  and 23 observational studies. Nutritional exposures included micronutrients  (e.g., vitamins D, K2), amino acids (e.g., L-arginine), multinutrient  formulations, microbiota-targeted therapies (e.g., probiotics, synbiotics),  nutritional status, diet quality, and whole-diet patterns (e.g., the  Mediterranean diet). Approximately 76% of studies reported improvements in long  COVID-19-related symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, physical function,  and markers of inflammation. Conclusions: Diet and nutrition may support long  COVID-19 recovery by targeting inflammation and the gut microbiome to alleviate  symptoms and improve functional outcomes. Well-powered trials of whole-diet  approaches, combined with targeted supplementation, are needed to confirm their  potential as scalable, accessible tools for post-COVID-19 recovery and  management.

Akl YMK(1), Soliman YA(1), Mohamed SA(1), Abdelghaffar ANF(1), Bayoumi AI(1).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University.  Respiratory problems in acute COVID-19 and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome vary  greatly, potentially leading to long-term functional difficulties. Off-label  usage of antifibrotics, such as pirfenidone, has emerged as a promising  treatment for post-COVID interstitial lung problems. Our study aims to assess  clinical and radiological lung abnormalities post-COVID-19 and the effect of  antifibrotics on the outcome. A retrospective observational study examined data  from 90 COVID-19 patients who completed the follow-up period in the post-COVID  clinic at the Chest Department, Kasr El Ainy Hospital, from August 2020 to  August 2022. Demographic data, comorbidities, exercise tolerance, and chest  computed tomography (CT) results were collected 1 and 6 months after the  diagnosis. Initial CT scans (1 month following hospital admission) revealed  diffuse ground-glass opacities (87.8%) and reticulations (43.3%). After 6  months, 33.3% were back to normal, 41% had persistent reticulations, 22.2% had  ground glass opacities, and 3.3% had bronchiectasis. CT scores improved  dramatically after 6 months. No significant link was detected between CT score  change and off-label use of pirfenidone. Antifibrotic therapy has a modest  effect on post-COVID lung problems. One-third of patients showed reticulations  as persistent radiological abnormalities, which could guide future treatment  choices.  DOI: 10.4081/monaldi.2025.3301 PMID: 40503629"

OBJECTIVES: To contrast long-term sequelae post-COVID-19 hospitalisations  attributed to Omicron, vs seasonal influenza; stratified by vaccination. METHODS: Retrospective population-based cohort study in Singapore, including all  adult COVID-19 hospitalisations post-Omicron emergence (1st January 2022-3rd  September 2023), and historical influenza hospitalisations (1st January 2017-3rd  September 2023). Risks of post-acute diagnoses/symptoms 31-300 days  post-COVID-19 hospitalisation, vs influenza, were estimated using  overlap-weighted competing-risks-regression, with death as a competing risk. RESULTS: 70,628 COVID-19 hospitalisations and 10,454 influenza hospitalisations  were included. Lower overall risk of post-acute cardiac symptoms  (adjusted-hazards-ratio, aHR = 0.77 [95% CI = 0.64-0.92]; P < 0.001) was  observed following any COVID-19 hospitalisation vs influenza. Similarly, lower  risk of any post-acute cardiac diagnosis/symptom (aHR = 0.80 [95% CI =  0.68-0.94]; P < 0.001) was observed following unboosted COVID-19  hospitalisations vs unvaccinated influenza, and lower risk of other cardiac  disorders (e.g., heart failure) was observed following boosted COVID-19  hospitalisations vs vaccinated influenza (aHR = 0.58 [95% CI = 0.39-0.86]; P <  0.001), However, risks of post-acute cognitive impairment and fatigue/malaise  were significantly higher post-COVID-19 vs influenza (cognition: aHR = 1.34 [95%  CI = 1.08-1.68]; P < 0.001; fatigue/malaise: aHR = 1.75 [95% CI = 1.23-2.50]; P  < 0.001) and when unboosted COVID-19 was compared against unvaccinated influenza  (memory/cognition: aHR = 1.67 [95% CI = 1.27-2.19; P < 0.001]; fatigue/malaise:  aHR = 1.77 [95% CI = 1.18-2.64]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risks of cognitive impairment/fatigue were increased while risk of  cardiac sequelae was significantly lower post-COVID-19 vs influenza in  unboosted/unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination for COVID-19/influenza remains  important during endemicity.  Copyright © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine,  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.  Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), also known as long COVID, is a complex multiple  organ system condition that can develop and persist for months after acute  COVID-19. PCC encompasses a wide range of symptoms, resulting in heterogeneous  clinical manifestations. These manifestations likely arise from diverse  underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, which, in turn, are influenced by risk  factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. To this end, characterising  clinical phenotypes of PCC is essential for deepening our understanding of its  (potentially) distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and for advancing  diagnostic and patient-tailored management strategies. PCC is thought to result  from a complex interaction of various pathophysiological mechanisms, leading to  functional and structural pathological alterations across multiple organ  systems. Investigating these alterations is critical to improving our currently  incomplete understanding of PCC's complex pathophysiology. This review provides  an overview of the main clinical phenotypes of PCC, characterises these  phenotypes by examining symptoms and signs, as well as the associated risk  factors. The main hypothesised pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed by  outlining the current knowledge on PCC pathology, focussing on the most commonly  affected organ systems. Current PCC management includes supportive care such as  physiotherapy and the repurposing of existing drugs primarily targeting  persistence of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. antivirals, monoclonal antibodies) and immune  dysfunction (e.g. antiinflammatory drugs, immunomodulators). To date, prevention  of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains critical, which can be achieved through  effective public health measures and vaccination strategies. Finally, this  review highlights current knowledge gaps and proposes future research directions  to advance the understanding and treatment of PCC. © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Post COVID-19 condition is a debilitating illness with over 200  symptoms across 10 organ systems and is presently impacting millions worldwide.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends a  multidisciplinary treatment approach including person-centred self-management  strategies, however evidence for specific programs is lacking. The Take Charge  intervention is a person-centred, self-management rehabilitation approach that  has been effective in recovery after stroke, but not yet tested in post COVID-19  condition. METHODS & ANALYSIS: A prospective, single-centre, parallel, 2 group, mixed  methods, randomized controlled trial with embedded process evaluation of the  Take Charge intervention in individuals living with post COVID-19 condition.  Participants will be at least 18 years of age, have a confirmed diagnosis of  post COVID-19 condition with ongoing symptoms, and be known to a hospital clinic  for assessment and treatment of patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.  The primary outcomes are the Modified COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale  and the COVID-19 Core Outcome Measure for Recovery. The secondary outcomes  include physical and self-report measures, and feasibility measures. Qualitative  interviews will also be conducted to understand the clinicians' and  participants' experiences. Statistical analysis will be performed on an  intention-to-treat basis using a multivariate mixed-effect linear regression  model. ETHICS & DISSEMINATION: This study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki. This  study was approved by the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics  Committee (approval number: 2022/SSA00695/OFR: 219.22, protocol version 3.3 19  February 2024). The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals,  conference presentations, and media.

Varenya A(1), Vijayalakshmi K(2), Babu MR(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Christ University (deemed to be), Bangalore,  Karnataka, India.

Beyond the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, survivors often grapple  with incapacitating post-infection symptoms, referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae  of COVID (PASC) when persistent beyond 90 days. Cognitive manifestations,  encompassing attention, memory, and executive functions (EF), collectively  termed brain fog, contribute to functional challenges in PASC. This infection  also elicits a long-lasting pro-inflammatory response that persists even after  viral clearance, potentially correlated with brain fog. However, it is unclear  whether pro-inflammatory responses and cognitive sequelae persist beyond 1 year  after the onset of infection. Thus, this study sought to investigate the  long-term consequences of PASC on EFs as well as a potential association with  markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC who passed performance  validity testing (PVT) and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent  neuropsychological assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to  assess global cognition, Victoria Stroop Test to assess inhibitory control,  Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess cognitive flexibility, Digit Span Task to  assess working memory, and Mackworth Clock Test to assess sustained attention on  the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) toolkit. Serum was assayed  for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results indicate  significant EF decline in PASC, inversely correlated with serum TNF-α  concentrations, approximately 562 ± 225 days after the onset of infection. Thus,  there exists protracted EF decline in PASC, persistent even beyond 1 year after  the onset of infection. Increased levels of TNF-α are observed to be associated  with poorer executive functioning in PASC.  © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.  DOI: 10.1002/jnr.70051 PMID: 40485151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

INTRODUCTION: Some people experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, brain  fog and breathlessness, long after the onset of COVID-19 infection. This is  known as the post-COVID syndrome (PCS). We developed a unique and holistic  psycho-physiological intervention that integrates Acceptance and Commitment  Therapy (ACT), a structured talking therapy, with principles of homeostasis.  This aims to provide targeted support and treatment strategies for effectively  managing the long-term repercussions of the condition and improve patient  outcomes. METHODS: This empirical study was informed by theory and other research strands.  These strands included a qualitative study of people with lived experience, a  scoping review of interventions for fatigue (including rehabilitation) and  insights from a patient and public involvement (PPI) group. The PPI group were  actively involved in the development of the intervention, manuals and overall  study management, ensuring it was relevant, ethical and aligned with patient  preferences and needs. RESULTS: The qualitative study uncovered the tangible contexts in which the  intervention would be implemented, and the attraction of Balance-ACT for those  living with PCS. People living with PCS (n = 19) and health care professionals  (HCPs; n = 12) provided overall endorsement for the intervention. Through an  iterative process, their feedback, alongside input from the PPI group, informed  the development of key materials, including a therapist manual, participant  handbook, mindfulness recordings and an animation. Therapists were trained, and  a novel fidelity measure was developed to ensure adherence to Balance-ACT  principles. CONCLUSION: We used an iterative approach to develop the Balance-ACT  intervention, which was acceptable to patients and HCPs. Subsequent research  will examine the efficacy of Balance-ACT. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This article represents work conducted as part  of the Balance-ACT project. People with the post-COVID condition (PCC) were  involved throughout all aspects of this study, in line with the National  Institute for Health and Care Research framework, and contributed in several key  ways. It ensured the research captured a diverse range of illness experiences.  The study design was refined and addressed potential barriers to engagement.  Patient-friendly language was used to improve accessibility, making the study  more inclusive. Additionally, the outcome measures were informed by patient  input to enhance their relevance. Finally, dissemination was guided to ensure  that the findings were both useful and accessible, using clear language in  reporting and incorporating feedback from patient representatives on drafts to  ensure clarity. C.B. recorded the mindfulness exercises and was a core part of  the management team throughout.  © 2025 The Author(s). Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess nasal epithelial transcriptomes of patients with  LC to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms for disease management. METHODS: Medical data and transcriptomes were obtained from participants in the  Precision Medicine for More Oxygen COVID-19 cohort at 3 to 6 months (n = 40) and  at 12 to 18 months (n = 15) post-COVID. Cell-type frequencies were estimated by  deconvolution from a single-cell data set. Hierarchical clustering identified  transcriptomic clusters and cellular clusters from which differences in gene  expression, gene set enrichment, and pulmonary phenotypes were assessed.  Functional validation was performed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and in vitro  assays in primary mutant nasal epithelium, and gene expression comparisons were  made with healthy controls (n = 51). RESULTS: At 3 to 6 and 12 to 18 months, transcriptomes associated with  inflammatory pathways (Padj < .05). Transcriptomic and cellular clusters were  identified and were related to inflammation and ciliogenesis (Padj < .05).  Comparison of transcriptomes of patients with and without pulmonary radiological  abnormalities resulted in 613 significant differentially expressed genes (Padj <  .05). Upregulated inflammatory genes were observed in patients with  abnormalities. SMURF1 expression was significantly increased in patients with  abnormalities compared with those without abnormalities and healthy controls.  SMURF1-/- mutant nasal epithelial cells produced significantly lower levels (P <  .05) of proinflammatory cytokines on virus exposure compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal epithelium in LC exhibits persistent inflammatory states.  SMURF1 upregulation potentially contributes to an exacerbated inflammatory state  in nasal epithelium of patients with radiological abnormalities. This study  demonstrates the importance of understanding these inflammatory profiles within  a clinical context and emphasizes the need for further assessment and validation  of SMURF1's role in LC.

Long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown since recovered  individuals can experience symptoms and latent viral reactivation for months.  Indeed, acute post-infection sequelae have also been observed in other  respiratory viral infections, including influenza. To characterize post-COVID-19  and post-influenza induced alterations to the cellular immunome, peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients 3 months after  recovery from COVID-19 (n = 93) or influenza (n = 25), and from pre-pandemic  healthy controls (n = 25). PBMCs were characterized using a 40-plex mass  cytometry panel. Principal component analysis (PCA), classification models, and  K-means clustering were subsequently applied. PCA identified distinct immune  profiles between cohorts, with both post-COVID and post-flu patients displaying  an altered chemokine receptor expression compared to pre-pandemic healthy  controls. These alterations were more prominent in post-COVID patients since  they exhibited highly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6  by various lymphoid populations, while post-influenza patients mainly showed a  decrease in CCR4 expression by naïve T cells, monocytes, and conventional  dendritic cells. Classification models using immunophenotyping data confirm the  three groups, while K-means clustering revealed two subgroups among post-COVID  patients, with younger patients showing more pronounced immune alterations in  the chemokine receptor profile, independently of long COVID symptoms. In  conclusion, post-COVID and post-influenza patients exhibit distinct and unique  persistent immune alterations. Understanding these altered immune profiles can  guide targeted therapies for post-COVID syndrome and highlight differences in  immune recovery from various respiratory infections.  © 2025 The Author(s).

This study investigated new incident clinical disorders in patients with  COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) 3.5 years post infection. We  analyzed 14,335 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March-2020 to  July-2023. cHIS was defined based on a point system that included elevated body  temperature, macrophage activation, hematological dysfunction, coagulopathy, and  hepatic enzyme. Outcomes were newly diagnosed disorders of hypertension,  diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma post COVID-19. Cumulative  incidences and hazard ratios were computed. Compared to non-cHIS patients, cHIS  patients were older, fewer female, more Blacks, higher prevalence of  pre-existing comorbidities. Patients with cHIS had higher risk of developing  cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.24 [1.04,1.47] p < 0.05), CKD (1.24 [1.01, 1.53]  p < 0.05), and obesity (1.61 [1.31,1.98], p < 0.001) but not hypertension,  diabetes, COPD, and asthma. Cumulative incidence analysis showed that  patients ≥ 50 years old showed markedly higher new incidences of individual new  disorders compared to patients < 50 years old. COVID-19 related  hyperinflammatory syndrome confers a significantly higher risk for developing  new common clinical disorders. Identifying risks for developing new clinical  disorders in patients with COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory syndrome may  encourage diligent follow-up of high-risk individuals.  © 2025.

The symptoms of long COVID are well-documented. However, the long-term effects  beyond 2 years remain poorly understood due to a lack of data. This systematic  review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence of persistent symptoms in  COVID-19 survivors 3 years following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. PubMed,  MEDLINE (Ovid), CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase were searched from  inception of the databases up to July 20, 2024, by two independent researchers  for articles reporting on the prevalence of persistent symptoms 3 years'  post-infection of people who survived COVID-19 infection. We employed a  random-effect model for the pooled analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size  was prevalence for the applicable end-points, I2 statistics, and quality  assessment of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Eleven articles  were included after the literature search yielded 223 potentially relevant  articles. We found that among patients with long COVID, fatigue, sleep  disturbances, and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Pooled analysis showed  that the proportion of individuals experiencing at least one persistent symptom  3 years post-COVID-19 is 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-43). The  prevalence of persistent symptoms was dyspnea (12%; 95% CI: 10-15), fatigue  (11%; 95% CI: 6-20), insomnia (11%; 95% CI: 2-37), loss of smell (7%; 95% CI:  5-8), loss of taste (7%; 95% CI: 3-16), and anxiety (6%; 95% CI: 1-32).  Prevalence of other findings include impaired diffusion capacity (42%; 95% CI:  34-50) and impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 s (10%; 95% CI: 8-12). Our  findings confirm the persistence of unresolved symptoms 3 years post-COVID-19  infection, with implications for future research, healthcare policy, and patient  care.  © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the acute and long-term sequelae of COVID-19  and its pathophysiology in African patients, who are known to have a distinct  immunological profile compared to Caucasian populations. Here, we established  protein signatures to define severe outcomes of acute COVID-19 and determined  whether unique protein signatures during the first week of acute illness predict  the risk of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (Long COVID) in a low-income country  (LIC) setting. METHOD: Using the Olink inflammatory panel, we measured the abundance of 92  proteins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n=55) and non-COVID-19 individuals  (n=23). We investigated distinct inflammatory protein signatures in acute severe  COVID-19 individuals (n=22) compared to asymptomatic or mild/moderate COVID-19  cases (n=33), and non-COVID-19 controls. RESULTS: Levels of SLAMF1, CCL25, IL2RB, IL10RA, IL15RA, IL18 and CST5 were  significantly upregulated in patients with critical COVID-19 illness compared to  individuals negative for COVID-19. The cohort was followed for an average of 20  months, and 23 individuals developed Long COVID, based on the WHO's case  definition, while 32 COVID-19 patients recovered fully. Whereas upregulated  levels of SLAMF1, TNF, TSLP, IL15RA, IL18, ADA, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL17C, and NT3 at  the acute phase of the illness were associated with increased Long COVID risk,  upregulated TRANCE was associated with a reduced risk of developing Long COVID.  Protein levels of SLAMF1, IL15RA, and IL18 associated with critical illness  during the acute phase of COVID-19 also predicted Long COVID risk. DISCUSSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 and Long COVID outcomes exhibited  distinct proteomic signatures. Unravelling the pathophysiology of severe acute  COVID-19 and Long COVID before its advent may contribute to designing novel  interventions for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection  and its associated acute and long-term consequences.

Long Covid is a post-viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms  targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current  literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral  persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial  dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of  various organs, SARS-CoV-2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering  immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine  imbalances, T-cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms  parallel other post-viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The  coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial  dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications.  Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post-exertion  malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation  and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid-impaired mitochondrial function.  This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid  pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral  persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to  understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the  long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve patient outcomes.  © 2025 American Physiological Society.

PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of the long-lasting symptoms which can follow an  infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus ('long covid') is not fully understood. The  'COroNaVirus post-Acute Long-term EffectS: Constructing an evidENCE base'  (CONVALESCENCE) study was established as part of the Longitudinal Health and  Wellbeing COVID-19 UK National Core Study. We performed a deep phenotyping  case-control study nested within two cohorts (the Avon Longitudinal Study of  Parents and Children and TwinsUK) as part of CONVALESCENCE. PARTICIPANTS: From September 2021 to May 2023, 349 participants attended the  CONVALESCENCE deep phenotyping clinic at University College London. Four  categories of participants were recruited: cases of long covid (long  covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(+)), alongside three control groups: those with neither long  covid symptoms nor evidence of prior COVID-19 (long covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(-);  control group 1), those who self-reported COVID-19 and had evidence of  SARS-CoV-2 infection, but did not report long covid (long  covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(+); control group 2) and those who self-reported persistent  symptoms attributable to COVID-19 but no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (long  covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(-); control group 3). Remote wearable measurements were  performed up until February 2024. FINDINGS TO DATE: This cohort profile describes the baseline characteristics of  the CONVALESCENCE cohort. Of the 349 participants, 141 (53±15 years old; 21  (15%) men) were cases, 89 (55±16 years old; 11 (12%) men) were in control group  1, 75 (49±15 years old; 25 (33%) men) were in control group 2 and 44 (55±16  years old; 9 (21%) men) were in control group 3. FUTURE PLANS: The study aims to use a multiorgan score calculated as the  cumulative total for each of nine domains (ie, lung, vascular, heart, kidney,  brain, autonomic function, muscle strength, exercise capacity and physical  performance). The availability of data preceding acute COVID-19 infection in  cohorts may help identify the consequences of infection independent of  pre-existing subclinical disease and also provide evidence of determinants that  influence the development of long covid.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 endemic phase, pulmonary sequelae substantially  contributed to disease burden. Immunologic responses may be critical in both  acute COVID-19 and in long-term sequelae. We aimed to evaluate associations  between convalescent neutralizing antibodies and long-term pulmonary sequelae in  patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Among patients who recovered from hospitalization due to COVID-19,  those who consented to participate in the study provided convalescent serum  between June 2021 and April 2022. These baseline patients were invited for a  second follow-up visit between September and November 2023. A serum sample was  collected at the second visit, and low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) was  performed. Pulmonary sequelae were defined as findings of fibrotic,  fibrotic-like, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs). Antibody and cytokine levels  were assessed in serum samples from the baseline convalescent phase, and  antibody levels were also measured in the serum sample at the second visit. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were enrolled at baseline, and 37 consented to  the second follow-up visit. Most second-visit patients (97.3%, 36/37) did not  require an oxygen supply beyond that provided via masks or nasal prongs.  Twenty-two patients (59.5%) exhibited pulmonary sequelae on chest CT at a median  follow-up period of 27 months (interquartile range 25-28, range 22-30) after  hospitalization for COVID-19. Fifteen patients (40.5%) had fibrotic or  fibrotic-like pulmonary changes, and twelve (32.4%) had GGOs. Pulmonary sequelae  were associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio 1.130, 95% confidence  interval 1.028-1.243; P = 0.011). There were no significant differences in  convalescent cytokines or neutralizing antibodies between patients with  pulmonary sequelae and those without. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary sequelae were quite common on chest CT after two years of  mild to moderate COVID-19 and were associated with older age. The immunological  or inflammatory status in the immediate post-acute infection period did not  predict long-term complications.  Copyright: © 2025 Lee et al.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory COVID-19 post-acute sequelae (PASC) may persist for  extended periods following recovery. METHODS: Patients with PASC who were referred for Salus Per Aquam (SPA) therapy  were enrolled in the study. AIM: To categorize patients based on the presence of dyspnea and fatigue, with a  specific focus on obesity, chronic respiratory conditions, and predictors of  rehabilitation outcomes. RESULTS: From July-November 2021, 327 consecutive patients were enrolled at the  spa center. Among these, 31% had been previously hospitalized, 5% had required  noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Approximately one-third of the  cohort underwent DLCO testing, which was abnormal in 56.3% of cases. Patients  with impaired DLCO had significantly higher dyspnea rates compared to those with  normal DLCO (88.9% vs. 64.3%, p < 0.0001). Dyspneic patients were more likely to  have one or more comorbidities (p < 0.001), be obese (p = 0.005), and have a  history of chronic respiratory disease (p = 0.0009). Patients reporting fatigue  also had higher rates of dyspnea (91.2% vs. 61.5%, p < 0.0001), were more  frequently obese (p = 0.03), had more comorbidities (p = 0.02), and had a  greater history of hospitalization (p = 0.02). No improvement in dyspnea/fatigue  was observed post-SPA treatment among patients with DLCO impairment and obese.  However, patients with chronic respiratory conditions reported benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnea in PASC is complex and multifactorial. The findings suggest  that SPA rehabilitation may be particularly beneficial for alleviating fatigue  and enhancing overall well-being in selected subgroups of patients with PASC.
